The positive effect of nicotine on the gastrointestinal and liver functions of mice was assessed by the expression of heLa-R1 (H2R1) and the expression of heLa-R3 (H3R3), respectively. HeLa-R1 was increased in mice lacking B-cell necropsy whereas the expression of heLa-R2 was decreased in mice lacking heLa-R1. The H2R1 and H3R3 expression was increased in mice without heLa-R1 antibodies but decreased in mice lacking heLa-R3. The expression of heLa-R3 was also decreased in mice with heLa-R1 antibodies but increased in mice lacking heLa-R3. The expression of heLa-R3 was increased in mice with heLa-R1 antibodies but decreased in mice without heLa-R1 antibodies. HeLa-R3 was increased in mice with heLa-R1 antibodies but decreased in mice with heLa-R2 antibodies. The expression of heLa-R1 and heLa-R3 was decreased in mice with heLa-R1 antibodies but decreased in mice with heLa-R2 antibodies. The expression of heLa-R4 and heLa-R5 was decreased in mice with heLa-R3 antibodies but decreased in mice with heLa-R2 antibodies. The expression of heLa-R6 and heLa-R7 were decreased in mice with heLa-R3 antibodies but decreased in mice with heLa-R5 antibodies. The expression of heLa-R8 and heLa-R9 was decreased in mice with heLa-R3 antibodies but decreased in mice with heLa-R4 antibodies. The expression of heLa-R10 and heLa-R11 was decreased in mice with heLa-R4 antibodies but decreased in mice with heLa-R3 antibodies. The expression of heLa-R12 and heLa-R13 was decreased in mice with heLa-R4 antibodies but decreased in mice with heLa-R5 antibodies. The expression of heLa-R14 and heLa-R15 was decreased in mice with heLa-R5 antibodies but decreased in mice with heLa-R1 antibodies. The expression of heLa-R16 was decreased in mice with heLa-R5 antibodies but decreased in mice with heLa-R2 antibodies.

The expression of heLa-R24 and heLa-R25 was decreased in mice with heLa-R5 antibodies but decreased in mice without heLa-R2 antibodies. The expression of heLa-R26 and heLa-R27 was decreased in mice with heLa-R2 antibodies but decreased in mice with heLa-R1 antibodies.

The expression of heLa-R28 and heLa-R29 was decreased in mice with heLa-R2 antibodies but decreased in mice without heLa-R1 antibodies.

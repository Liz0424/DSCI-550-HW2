The man, identified as Giuseppe Pozzi, died at the scene at the scene of the crash, according to local media.

His death is the first in the region to be caused by an accident, after a car accident in the vicinity of the city of Siena in March.

The passenger in the car, a 43-year-old man from Lampedusa, was killed, as a result of his injury, local media reported.

An investigation was carried out by the police, who discovered Pozzi's vehicle was uninjured at the scene.

The driver of the car was identified as Luigi Varela, a 31-year-old physiotherapist from Lampedusa.

He was killed in the crash.

The CACTA has confirmed that the man who was killed was a 31-year-old man, and that he was killed in the car.

Lampedusa Mayor Marcello Galli was quick to express his shock over the death of Pozzi, stating that the man was involved in a car-related accident.

"It is very disappointing that he was killed in a car accident in the city of Lampedusa," Galli said. "His death was caused by an accident.

"His death was a severe loss to the city. His family will always be grateful to the Lampedusa Council for their support and their support during this difficult time.

"As the car was brought down by two people, the car-related accident and the car-related death of the man, we will always try to be as fast as possible on this particular day for Lampedusa."

The investigation into the death of Pozzi will take place at the local level.

The Italian media reported that the man was a naturalized European citizen and that he had been studying to become a medical doctor.

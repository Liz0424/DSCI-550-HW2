Prenatal exposure of the rat to various antianxiety drugs (diazepam, diazepam-piperidine and tesperate) could impair the development of the rat psychiatric precursor syndrome. To evaluate whether these intracellular alterations were differentially expressed in the rat brain, we used the rat brain microarray analysis in a model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with a first author as the active author. To examine whether these intracellular alterations could be caused by the effects of antianxiety drugs in the rat, we used the rat brain microarray. Accordingly, we found that antianxiety drugs induced by antianxiety-related antianxiety drugs were significantly more potent in rat brain.

Our aim was to examine whether antianxiety drugs induced by antianxiety-related antianxiety drugs were related to the development of the rat psychiatric precursor syndrome. Here we report that antianxiety drugs induced by antianxiety-related antianxiety drugs are significantly more potent in rat brain.

In this study, we reported that antianxiety drugs induced by antianxiety-related antianxiety drugs are significantly more potent in rat brain. The present study examined whether antianxiety drug induced by antianxiety-related antianxiety drugs is related to the development of the rat psychiatric precursor syndrome.

In this study, we reported that antianxiety drugs induced by antianxiety-related antianxiety drugs are significantly more potent in rat brain. The present research confirms that antianxiety drug induced by antianxiety-related antianxiety drugs are significantly more potent in rat brain.

Our method was designed to examine whether antianxiety-related antianxiety drugs induced by antianxiety-related antianxiety drugs are related to the development of the rat psychiatric precursor syndrome. We used the rat brain microarray analysis in a model of AD to examine whether antianxiety drugs induced by antianxiety-related antianxiety drugs are related to the development of the rat psychiatric precursor syndrome.

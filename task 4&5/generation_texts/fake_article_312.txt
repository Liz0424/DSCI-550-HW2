Bakker-Akt and Tarb-Bkt (PST) in vitro. To examine whether these drugs could inhibit MMP-1 expression, we incubated BAKK-Akt at room temperature for 4 h and confirmed that the inhibitory effect of BAKK-Akt was transiently and was abolished with the addition of THF, and that BAKK-Akt failed to inhibit MMP-1 expression in vitro. Inhibition of MMP-1 expression in the absence of BAKK-Akt resulted in the suppression of MMP-1 expression in the absence of BAKK-Akt. These results indicate that BAKK-Akt could inhibit MMP-1 expression in vitro.

The 18th of April is National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, and for that the Breast Cancer Society of America (BCSA) has created a special page with a special profile for this month. Breast Cancer Awareness Month is a time to recognize the cancer in our bodies, and have a positive impact on the lives of our patients.

The page is free to view and may be downloaded as a PDF file.

The researchers analyzed data from the Breast Cancer Society of America, a leading online publication on breast cancer. The study was funded by the Breast Cancer Research, Inc. (BCSA) as well as the Breast Cancer Foundation.

Biological samples of the 903 breast cancer patient samples from the Breast Cancer Society of America were analyzed at various stages of treatment (multiple transections, invasive procedures, and invasive procedures) for a variety of cancer types and causes.

A total of 1,068 breast cancer patients including over 1,000 less than 5 years of age were analyzed using a scientific project (Biological Fractionation). The overall rate of cancer was 5.5% for the 903 patients compared to the 549 patients compared to the 549 patients. The cancer rates of the 903 patients were similar to the general population (Figure 4).

The 24-hour survival rate for the 903 patients was 5.8% compared to the 549 patients. The survival rate for the 506 patients was 0.9% compared to the 549 patients. The survival rate for the 6-month survival time was 1.8% compared to the 549 patients. The survival rate for the 6-month survival time was 2.5% compared to the 549 patients. The survival rate for the 8-month survival time was 1.7% compared to the 549 patients.

The cancer-specific survival rate for the 903 patients was 0.9% compared to the 549 patients. The cancer-specific survival rate for the 8-month survival time was 0.8% compared to the 549 patients.

The cancer-specific survival rate for the 903 patients was 0.1% compared to the 549 patients.

The cancer-specific survival rate for the 8-month survival time was 0.8% compared to the 549 patients.

The cancer-specific survival rate for the 903 patients was 0.1% compared to the 549 patients.

The cancer-specific survival rate for the 903 patients was 0.4% compared to the 549 patients.

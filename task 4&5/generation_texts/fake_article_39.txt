Bannon is the first to report on the formation of arthropod–induced neurodegenerative diseases, and their prevalence. This study identifies three classes of arthropod–induced neurodegenerative diseases: neurodegenerative diseases (NAD), neurodegenerative disorders (NADD), and mitochondrial diseases (MAD).

In this study, we identified four neurodegenerative diseases, namely Alzheimer, Parkinsonism, and Parkinsonism-associated neurodegenerative diseases (PDPHs). The disease-specific criteria for neurodegenerative diseases are: NADD; PDPHs; MAD. The study also identified a neurodegenerative disorder, termed NMDA receptor-mediated neurotoxicity (NMDA-DRT) in Alzheimer's disease. The NADD-PDPH disorders are characterized by decreased intracellular calcium levels, increased intracellular calcium turnover, and decreased intracellular potassium turnover (PKK). The PDPHs are characterized by decreased potassium turnover, increased intracellular calcium turnover, and increased intracellular potassium turnover (PKK). The PDPHs have been shown to be resistant to treatment with a wide range of antibiotics and various antifungal agents, although the data are limited. The dopamine-dependent neurotoxicity is also evident in the PDPHs, as shown by the increase in the level of the intracellular calcium, the decrease in intracellular potassium, and the decrease in potassium turnover.

It has been demonstrated that the NADD-PDPH disorders are characterized by decreased intracellular calcium, increased intracellular potassium, and decreased intracellular potassium turnover. However, the NADD-PDPHs are characterized by decreased intracellular calcium, increased intracellular potassium, and decreased intracellular potassium turnover. The present study may help clarify the mechanism of the reduced intracellular calcium and potassium turnover in the PDPHs.

NADD-PDPHs are characterized by decreased intracellular calcium, increased intracellular potassium, and decreased intracellular potassium turnover. The NADD-PDPHs are characterized by decreased intracellular potassium turnover, increased intracellular potassium turnover, and decreased intracellular potassium turnover. The NADD-PDPHs are characterized by decreased intracellular potassium turnover, increased intracellular potassium turnover, and decreased intracellular potassium turnover. In addition, NADD-PDPHs have been shown to be resistant to treatment with a wide range of antibiotics and various antifungals, including an antibiotic prophylaxis and a chemopreventive agent, both of which have been used to treat NADD-PDPHs in patients with NADD-PDPHs. Our findings suggest that the lower intracellular calcium and potassium levels in NADD-PDPHs are due to the decreased intracellular calcium and potassium turnover in the PDPHs.

(Phys.org)—Chronic stress is a major cause of the decline in blood oxygen levels, leading to a decrease in the oxygen content and cell viability. This process can be directly attributed to the stress response of various cell types.

The current study investigated the mechanisms by which acute stress or stress-induced cell death can result in the death of host cells through apoptosis. This study involved four different cell types: E. coli, T. rex, and T. rex+/− cells.

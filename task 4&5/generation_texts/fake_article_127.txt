E. All serum levels of reactive oxygen species were measured using a QIAB system. Results indicated that, in the presence of caspase-3, the levels of reactive oxygen species in serum were significantly higher at day 4 than at day 9.

CONCLUSION: In this study, the risk of type II diabetes was reduced in patients with Adi-DAT, suggesting the importance of adenovirus A
in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus.

INSPIRITATORY METHODS

The primary objective of this study was to determine the effect of caspase-3 on the expression of reactive oxygen species in serum samples from Adi-DAT patients. The results reported herein are representative of the literature and do not imply that the adenovirus A
has direct relevance to Adi-DAT.

Treatment with caspase-3 reduced the level of reactive oxygen species in serum samples at day 4. Furthermore, no significant change in the levels of reactive oxygen species was observed at day 11, indicating that the adenovirus A
has not completely disappeared from Adi-DAT. These results suggest the importance of adenovirus A in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus.

Treatment with caspase-3 decreased the levels of reactive oxygen species in serum samples at day 4, suggesting that the adenovirus A
has not completely disappeared from Adi-DAT.

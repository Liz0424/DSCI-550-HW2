In the case of a phenotypic defect, a genomic region of the tumor has been identified. In this case, we identified a region that has been identified as the precursor region for gene expression. In this scenario, the gene expression of the gene has been detected by a quantitative PCR assay. The expression of the gene is also confirmed with western blotting.

To confirm the presence of the gene, we constructed a region of the tumor that contains a new gene sequence. The mRNA for the gene is located on the western surface of the tumor. Since the expression of the gene is confirmed with western blotting, we used the Western blotting assay. The expression of the gene is also confirmed with western blotting. The gene expression of the gene has been detected by a quantitative PCR assay.

The expression of the gene is also confirmed with western blotting, but the expression of the gene is not detected with western blotting either.

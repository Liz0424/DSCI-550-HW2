Cerebral fluid-forming assay (CFA), which was designed specifically for CFA, was used to compare plasma concentrations of RNA-seq data from three separate experiments.

RESULTS:

Cerebral fluid-forming assay (CFA) was performed in 24 h after an elevated daily plasma dose of 5.0% (n = 3) of plasma was administered to nude mice. The mean plasma concentrations (P < 0.05) of RNA-seq data from three separate experiments were analyzed using the TaqMan Unfiltered RNA Strain (TQ-STRA) method.

CONCLUSION:

Cerebral fluid-forming assay is an essential part of the identification of CNS lesions.

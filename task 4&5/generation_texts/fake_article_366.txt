Taken together with the effect of a high alpha-catalase inhibiting TGF-cadherin on the expression of the transcription factors tumor suppressor genes are shown in Fig. 1A. (B) The suppression of tumor suppressor genes is significantly inhibited when a high alpha-catalase inhibitor is applied to the tumor suppressor gene promoter (TGF-cadherin) and the activated TGF-cadherin promoter (TGF-catalase) of the tumor suppressor gene promoter. (C) The suppression of tumor suppressor genes is significantly inhibited when a high alpha-catalase inhibitor is applied to the tumor suppressor gene promoter (TGF-catalase) of the tumor suppressor gene promoter.

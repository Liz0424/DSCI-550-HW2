Molecular data are used in this study. A) The presence of pH7a1 is a novel mechanism of COC-induced cell death in which the protein protein pH7a1 is amplified by pH7a1 in a total of 7.2% of the cells, which is a very low fraction (Figure 5B). B) Similar to COC, pH7a1 is expressed in the absence of pH7a1 (Figure 6A). The presence of pH7a1 is translocated into the cytoplasm at the site of ligation.

COC is a substrate required for the mobility of cell membranes. The membrane of COC is mainly composed of a few proteins, namely, pH7a1, pH7a1a, and pH7a2. Therefore, pH7a1 has been proposed to be a source of pH7a1 protein (Figure 5B). The pH7a1 protein is expressed in the presence of pH7a1, but has been reported to be translocated into the cytoplasm at the sites of translation. The pH7a2 protein is expressed in the presence of pH7a2, but has been described to be translocated into the cytoplasm at the site of translation.

In order to determine the function of pH7a1, pH7a1, and pH7a2 in COC, we compared the numbers of pH7a1 and pH7a2 in the presence or absence of pH7a1, pH7a2, and pH7a1 in the presence or absence of pH7a2. In both cases, pH7a1 protein was expressed at the site of translation. The pH7a2 protein was expressed at the site of translation. The pH7a1 protein was expressed at the site of translation.

In both cases, pH7a1 protein was expressed at the site of translation. The pH7a2 protein was expressed at the site of translation.

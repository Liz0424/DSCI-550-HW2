The bacterium Toll-like receptors (TLR) are widely expressed in the human lung. Mice lacking TLR antibodies were infected with a similar infection (Figure 6A). These mice showed increased CD8+ T-lymphocyte expression in the absence of TLR antibodies (Figure 6B), whereas mice without TLR antibody showed increased CD4+ T-lymphocyte expression (Figure 6C). A further study by L. cholerae (2011) suggested that the infected mouse brain may be primed to recognize T-lymphocyte-specific antigen (T-lymphocyte antigen) in the absence of TLR antibodies. T-lymphocyte antigen was detected in the brain of infected mice (Figure 6D).

To determine whether TLR-dependent expression is a marker of innate immunity, we examined the expression levels of TLR-dependent genes in human chronic inflammatory arthritis, which are associated with severe chronic inflammation. The levels of TLR-dependent genes in chronic inflammatory arthritis decreased with increasing age, but increased with increasing age (Figure 6E). TLR-dependent gene levels were also reduced with increasing age and with increasing inflammation (Figure 6F).

To assess the role of TLR-dependent genes in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory arthritis, we examined the expression levels in the human inflammatory arthritis mouse model. The cytokine IL-1β was upregulated in chronic inflammatory arthritis (CARE) mice, a mouse model for chronic inflammation. IL-1β was upregulated in chronic inflammatory arthritis (CARE) mice, a mouse model for chronic inflammation. These data indicate that the cytokine IL-1β is a major cytokine in chronic inflammatory arthritis.

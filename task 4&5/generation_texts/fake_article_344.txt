The slow down of blood glucose is a common cause of diabetic ketoacidosis.2-4 The importance of glucose-sensitive insulin resistance in insulin resistance is well established and is a major contributor to the development of diabetes mellitus, which can be characterized by an increase in insulin-resistant insulin resistance.4-7 The role of insulin resistance in diabetes mellitus is frequently expressed in the acute phase of the disease and is often accompanied by a decrease in insulin resistance in the chronic phase. One method to quantify the insulin sensitivity of diabetic patients is to use a scale measuring the insulin sensitivity of 24-h glucose tolerance test. The estimated insulin sensitivity is obtained by measuring insulin levels and using a memory-based approach. The response of insulin resistance is assessed by a single-point scale, with the individual scores corresponding to the study method. The dependent variable of insulin sensitivity is the acute phase of the disease. The independent variable of insulin resistance is the chronic phase.

Introduction
In a very large population of diabetic patients, chronic glucose intolerance (CGS) has been associated with a positive correlation with CGS and has been defined in this way by the term CGS. Previous studies have suggested that CGS can be associated with a positive correlation with CGS, although no studies have examined the relationship between CGS and glucose tolerance.1-3 We present a novel method to quantify the insulin sensitivity of diabetic ketoacidosis (DM) by measuring insulin levels and using a memory-based approach. The measured insulin sensitivity of diabetes patients is characterized by a single-point scale, with the individual scores corresponding to the study method. Our method is based on a design from the Fondazione diabetologologiae Adizio Renzo (FREA), based on the point-of-care.1

Metabolic syndrome is a complex of metabolic inflammatory disorders (MOS) and is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide.1,15-22 The role of insulin resistance in diabetes mellitus is often expressed in the acute phase of the disease, and is often accompanied by a decrease in insulin resistance in the chronic phase. The most commonly expressed factor in insulin resistance is glucose tolerance, and is associated with a negative correlation with insulin resistance in diabetic patients.1-3,22-24

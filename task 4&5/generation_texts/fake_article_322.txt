The aim of this study was to explore the effects of bovine balm on the interrelationship between microglial production and the expression of the p53 pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-6. 

The cytokine IL-6 is a target of the cell cycle and is required for the induction of apoptosis .
The p53 is a target of the cell cycle and required for the induction of apoptosis.
We found that bovine balm inhibits the expression of the p53 pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-6. 

We further found that bovine balm inhibited the expression of the p53 pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-6.

We also found that the p53 is required for the induction of apoptosis.
The results indicate that bovine balm inhibits the p53 pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-6. 

These results are in agreement with the notion that bovine balm inhibits the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-6. 

We also found that the p53 is required for the induction of apoptosis.

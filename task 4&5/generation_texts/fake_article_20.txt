Methylene blue

polyethylene

naphthalate

dilution

of an anti-

prostaglandin

inhibitor.

PCR was carried out in the following

methods:

SDS-PAGE, centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 10 min at

50°C. The blue light was irradiated

with 2,000 lux for 2 h and then transferred to a

CDS buffer (Bio-Rad) containing 1,000 lux for 1 h.

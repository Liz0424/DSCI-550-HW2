In this study we examined the association between the glucose concentration and right-handedness of the PRS-2-tNF (PL-2) protein of the PRS-2-TNF protein family and the expression of the protein in the right-handedness-related gene Staphylococcus aureus (PL-2) in mice. We observed that the protein expression in the PRS-2-TNF gene was significantly increased in mice with both right-handedness and PRS-2-TNF expression. The protein expression of the PRS-2-TNF protein was significantly decreased in mice with both right-handedness and PRS-2-TNF expression.

PL-2 is a protein part of the protein family known as the PRS2-TNF protein family. The PRS-2-TNF protein family is stable at the level of the protein in the membrane. It has been shown to regulate the expression of the protein in the left-handedness gene of Staphylococcus aureus (PL-2) in the mouse. The publication was supported by a grant from the Elsevier Foundation, the Society for Microbiology, the Circulation Research Foundation, and the NRP Foundation.

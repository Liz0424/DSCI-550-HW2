The meningococcal strain of the T. rex strain (5 pM) was used to isolate the cellular component of the bacterial cell wall as described (8). The antibiotic
incubation of the T. rex strain was carried out using the Streptococcus
IEC-green fluorescent staining system [10]. The bacterial cell wall was prepared in the presence of 5 μM of 2 tetracycline, and the bacterial culture was
compared to human culture. The bacterial culture was fixed by immersion in 1% CO2 for 4 h, and the bacterial culture was re-washed in 1% CO2 for each 4-h period. The cultures were incubated at 37°C for 1 h, and the bacterial culture was re-washed in 1% CO2 for each 4-h period. The bacteria were then washed in a 1% CO2 solution for 48 h. The bacteria were then re-washed in 1% CO2 solution for 1 h, and the culture was re-washed in 1% CO2 solution for the next 4 h. The culture was washed in 1% CO2 solution for each 4-h period.

Metabolism of the bacterial culture

Bacteria were stored at −20°C. The bacteria were concentrated in a 5% solution of an anti-beta-galactosidase system (0.1M sodium pyruvicin sulfate, 1% paraformaldehyde, 1% CO2) for 30 min at room temperature. The bacteria were then excised by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm and the bacteria were stored at −20°C. The bacteria were then subjected to the same control conditions, and the culture was re-washed in 5% CO2 solution for 30 min. The bacterial culture was then re-washed in 1% CO2 solution for 1 h, and the bacteria were then re-washed in 1% CO2 solution for each 4-h period.

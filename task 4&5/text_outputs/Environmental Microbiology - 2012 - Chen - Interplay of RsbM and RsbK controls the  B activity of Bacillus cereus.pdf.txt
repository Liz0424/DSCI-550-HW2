Summary

The alternative transcription factor sB of Bacillus
cereus controls the expression of a number of
genes that respond to environmental stress. Four
proteins encoded in the sigB gene cluster, including
RsbV, RsbW, RsbY (RsbU) and RsbK, are known to
be essential in the sB-mediated stress response. In
the context of stress, the hybrid sensor kinase RsbK
is thought to phosphorylate the response regulator
RsbY, a PP2C serine phosphatase, leading to the
dephosphorylation of the phosphorylated RsbV. The
unphosphorylated RsbV then sequesters the sB

antagonist, RsbW, ultimately liberating sB. The gene
arrangement reveals an open reading frame, bc1007,
flanked immediately downstream by rsbK within the

sigB gene cluster. However, little is known about the
function of bc1007. In this study, the deletion of
bc1007 resulted in high constitutive sB expression
independent of environmental stimuli, indicating that
bc1007 plays a role in sB regulation. A bacterial two-
hybrid analysis demonstrated that BC1007 interacts
directly with RsbK, and autoradiographic studies
revealed a specific C14-methyl transfer from the
radiolabelled S-adenosylmethionine to RsbK when
RsbK was incubated with purified BC1007. Our data
suggest that BC1007 (RsbM) negatively regulates
sB activity by methylating RsbK. Additionally,
mutagenic substitution was employed to modify 12
predicted methylation residues in RsbK. Certain
RsbK mutants were able to rescue sB activation in a
rsbK-deleted bacterial strain, but RsbKE439A failed to
activate sB, and RsbKE446A only moderately induced
sB. These results suggest that Glu439 is the pre-
ferred methylation site and that Glu446 is potentially
a minor methylation site. Gene arrays of the rsbK
orthologues and the neighbouring rsbM orthologues
are found in a wide range of bacteria. The regulation
of sigma factors through metylation of RsbK-like
sensor kinases appears to be widespread in the
microbial world.

Introduction

Bacillus cereus is a gram-positive, facultatively anaerobic,
spore-forming bacterium that produces a large number of
virulence factors that can either cause food-borne ill-
nesses with emetic and diarrhoeal symptoms or promote
opportunistic infections (Agata et al., 1996; Ehling-Schulz
et al., 2004; Schoeni and Wong, 2005). In the context of
food processing or host immune pressure, the bacterial
stress response is a major determinant of bacterial cell
survival and growth (Mihaljevic et al., 2007; Zotta et al.,
2008). A range of alternative bacterial transcription factors
with distinct promoter specificities can confer resistance
to multiple stressors by controlling the transcription of
different regulons (Missiakas and Raina, 1998; Gruber
and Gross, 2003; Kazmierczak et al., 2005). The alterna-
tive transcription factor sB of B. cereus governs the tran-
scription of sB-dependent genes and enables the cells to
counteract fluctuations in temperature, pH or osmolarity
(Price, 2002; Hecker et al., 2007).

sB is regulated by a partner-switching mechanism that
has been extensively studied in Bacillus subtilis. RsbV
and RsbW comprise the basic core proteins of sB regula-
tion, and they participate in protein–protein interactions
and/or the mechanisms of serine/threonine phosphoryla-
tion. In unstressed cells, sB is kept inactive by sequestra-
tion in a protein complex with the anti-sigma factor RsbW,
which prevents sB from associating with the core RNA
polymerase (Alper et al., 1996; Voelker et al., 1996;
Delumeau et al., 2002). RsbW is a bi-functional protein
that also acts as a kinase and can phosphorylate the
anti-anti-sigma factor RsbV. Phosphorylated RsbV does
not have the capability to sequester RsbW. When under
conditions of stress, two serine/threonine protein phos-
phatases, RsbP and RsbU, catalyse the dephosphoryla-
tion of phosphorylated RsbV, and the unphosphorylated
RsbV then forms an alternative complex with RsbW,
thereby allowing sB to bind to RNA polymerase.

In contrast to the regulatory strategy of partner-
switching mechanisms, the two-component signal trans-
duction system (TCS) is a common regulation module in
bacteria for environmental adaptation, such as the induc-
tion of virulence factors, the formation of biofilms, the
initiation of sporulation, chemotaxis, quorum sensing, and
the utilization of nutrients (Hoch and Silhavy, 1995; Stock
et al., 2000; Galperin, 2006). Typical TCSs are comprised
of a sensor and a response regulator (RR). Upon receiv-
ing environmental stimuli, the sensor initiates autophos-
phorylation of a conserved histidine residue in the H-box
and transfers the phosphate to the downstream RR by
direct phosphoryl transfer or through a more complex,
multi-step His-Asp-His-Asp transfer via the histidine-
containing phosphotransferase (Hpt) protein (Hoch and
Silhavy, 1995; Stock et al., 2000; Bijlsma and Groisman,
2003). In most cases, the phosphorylation of the RR
receiver (REC) domain can modulate the function of the
coupled output domain (Hoch, 2000; Thomas et al.,
2008), thus modifying DNA binding or other regulatory
functions. The reversible methylation of specific glutamate
residues in the cytoplasmic domains of chemoreceptors
is known to control bacterial chemotaxis through a TCS
signalling route (Wadhams and Armitage, 2004). Two
competing enzymes control the receptor methylation
status: CheR, a methyltransferase, and CheB, a
methylesterase/deamidase.

In B. cereus, RsbY, which is homologous to RsbU and
RsbP in B. subtilis, is required for sB activation. RsbY
contains a PP2C-type protein phosphatase domain in its
C-terminal region, it presumably hydrolyses phosphory-
lated RsbV. The N-terminal domain of RsbY is homolo-
gous to the CheY-like REC domains of TCSs (van Schaik
et al., 2005). Based on domain analysis and genome
context, de Been and co-workers proposed a model in
which RsbK is a hybrid sensor kinase that controls RsbY

phosphatase activity via the phosphorylation of the
N-terminal REC domain of RsbY (de Been et al., 2010).
Therefore, sB activity of B. cereus is likely regulated by a
partner-switching mechanism associated with specific
TCSs. In the present study, we reveal bc1007 to be
flanked downstream by rsbK, encoding a CheR-type
methyltransferase that is capable of methylating RsbK
and functions as a negative regulator of sB. The probable
methylation sites of RsbK were further assessed by
residue substitution.

Results

Investigation of the role of BC1007 in sB activation

The sigB gene cluster of B. cereus strain ATCC 14579
encodes an open reading frame, bc1007, flanking rsbY
and rsbK, and the consecutive rsbK and bc1007 comprise
an operon (Fig. 1A). A previous study suggested that
RsbK and RsbY form a TCS in which RsbK transfers a
phosphoryl group to RsbY (de Been et al., 2010). BC1007
is supposed to encode a methyl-accepting chemotaxis
protein (MCP) methyltransferase (de Been et al., 2011).
However, the function of BC1007 has not yet been dem-
onstrated. To determine whether BC1007 is involved in sB

regulation, the bc1007 deletion strain KNU701 was gen-
erated in this study (Fig. 1B). The deletion of bc1007 did
not affect cell morphology or cell growth compared with
the wild-type strain (data not shown). To further under-
stand the function of bc1007, KNU701 was exposed to
42°C temperatures and analysed by immunoblot for the
detection of the sB, Dps-like bacterioferritin (BC1005), and
EF-TU (translation elongation factor, a housekeeping
protein used as an internal control) proteins. Interestingly,
in contrast to a wild-type strain, the heat stress did not
influence sB activity due to the high basal level in the
mutant (Fig. 2A). This pattern of sB expression was vali-
dated by a similar effect of the Dps-like bacterioferritin
(BC1005), a member of the sB-dependent regulon
(Fig. 2A). In the complementary strain KNU703 harbour-
ing pHT304-rsbK-bc1007 (Fig. 1C), sB activity was similar
to that observed in the wild-type control but not in the
mock control strain KNU702 (Fig. 2A). This result indi-
cated that BC1007 directly or indirectly influences sB

activity. As sB is known to induce the transcription of
genes important in the response to stress, we performed
a time-course experiment to examine the effect of
BC1007 on cell survival when cells were exposed to lethal
temperatures. Both wild-type and KNU701 strains were
subjected to heat shock with a gradually increased tem-
perature from 30°C to 50°C, the lethal temperature, and
cell viability was determined by plate count. Consistent
with the sB levels detected with the immunoblot (Fig. 2A),
the KNU701 strain demonstrated relatively higher survival

rates when compared with the wild-type strain, particularly
from 10 to 25 min (Fig. 2B).

Analysis of the interactions between RsbY, BC1007 and
RsbK using the bacterial two-hybrid assay

According to the gene arrangements, our result indicated
that protein–protein interactions may be occurring
between the neighbouring gene products RsbY, BC1007
and RsbK. Thus, the bacterial two-hybrid system was
employed to examine this potential interaction (Fig. 3A).
Full-length rsbY and rsbK were first inserted into the
expression vectors pKT-25 and pUT-18 respectively, and
the constructs were then co-transformed into Escherichia
coli BTH101. Colony growth on selective plates indicated
a significant interaction between RsbK and RsbY

(Fig. 3B). Using a similar method, a positive phenotype on
selective media also indicated a significant interaction
between RsbK and BC1007, but BC1007 had no apparent
interaction with RsbY (Fig. 3B). Previously, the expression
of a C-terminal REC domain-truncated rsbK moderately
increased sB levels in the rsbK deletion strain (de Been
et al., 2010). Therefore, we attempted to investigate
whether the REC-truncated RsbK interacted with RsbY.
However, the combination of RsbY and the REC-
truncated RsbK did not exhibit a positive colony pheno-
type on MacConkey and LB selection plates (Fig. 3B), but
blue colonies grown on M63 selection medium were
present, indicating that the loss of the REC domain dimin-

ished the protein interaction between RsbK and RsbY.
Our data reveal that RsbK interacts directly not only with
RsbY but also with BC1007.

Methylation of RsbK by BC1007 in vitro

The results of the two-hybrid analysis indicated that RsbK
interacts with BC1007, but the nature of the interaction
remains unknown. We cloned both the intact rsbK gene
and rsbK-bc1007 individually into the expression vector
pET21b to overexpress His-tagged RsbK (RsbK-His6) or
His6-tagged BC1007 (BC1007-His6) to determine whether
RsbK is the target protein for BC1007. The protein levels
of purified BC1007 and overexpressed His-tagged RsbK
of E. coli cell lysate were resolved by SDS-PAGE, in
which RsbK-His6 (Fig. 4A, lanes 2 and 3) and two other
protein bands representing BC1007-His6 and its degraded
derivative BC1007-His6 (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 3) were
visualized. The presence of each protein was confirmed
by Western blot using anti-His6 monoclonal antibody, and
RsbK-His6 was further verified by mass spectrometry
(data not shown). To conduct RsbK methylation in vitro,
cell lysates derived from His-tagged RsbK overexpression
in E. coli (Fig. 4A) were incubated with the purified

BC1007-His6 in the presence of C14-methyl-labelled
S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and subjected to autorad-
iography. As a control, C14-methyl SAM was also incu-
bated individually with the His-tagged RsbK cell lysate
(Fig. 4B, lane 2) and the purified BC1007-His6 (Fig. 4B,
lane 1). A radiolabelled signal clearly appeared at the
molecular weight corresponding to RsbK when the puri-
fied BC1007-His6 was mixed with the His-tagged RsbK
cell lysate (Fig. 4B, lane 3). This signal could not be attrib-
uted to endogenous E. coli methyltransferases because
no signal was observed in the control reactions (Fig. 4B,
lane 2). The result demonstrated that BC1007 is able to
specifically transfer the methyl group(s) from SAM to
RsbK.

Identification of putative methylation sites by
site-directed mutagenesis

Although our data demonstrated that RsbK can be methy-
lated by BC1007 in vitro, it is still unclear which residue(s)
in RsbK is/are methylated. Recently, a systematic analysis
suggested that potential methylation substrates have con-
served glutamate and glutamine residues at the ‘b’ and ‘c’
positions of the ‘a-b-c-d-e-f-g’ coiled-coil heptad repeat

(Terwilliger et al., 1986; Nowlin et al., 1987; Le Moual and
Koshland, 1996; Perez et al., 2006). The presence of six
methylation consensus sequences from Glu431 to Thr472 in
RsbK has been proposed, indicating 12 putative methyla-
tion sites at conserved glutamate and glutamine residues
(Fig. 5A) (de Been et al., 2011). We studied the function of
these putative RsbK methylation sites by constructing 24
RsbK methylation point mutants (rsbKm) (Table S2) where
a methylatable glutamate residue was replaced with either
an aspartate or an alanine residue. These substitutions
were used in other bacteria to mimic unmethylated and
methylated glutamates respectively. The aspartate resi-
dues, which cannot be methylated, maintain the negative
charge of a glutamate residue, whereas the naturally
charged alanine residues, similar to methyl esterified
glutamates, cause less perturbation to the predicted
a-helix (Nowlin et al., 1988; Park et al., 1990; Shapiro and
Koshland, 1994).

The intact operon rsbKm-bc1007 was then cloned into
the low-copy vector pHT304, and the resulting plasmid
pHT304-rsbKm-bc1007 was introduced into the rsbK dele-
tion strain (KNU802). Subsequently, sB levels were analy-
sed by Western blot in each strain after 42°C exposure. sB

activation was abolished in KNU802 compared with the
wild-type strain (Fig. 5B). However, sB activation was
restored when KNU802 was complemented with the
pHT304-rsbK-bc1007 plasmid. Similarly, restoration of sB

activity was observed when KNU802 harboured any of the
plasmids expressing various RsbK methylation mutations,
except for RsbKE439A, and lower expression levels of sB

were observed when complemented with RsbKE446A
(Fig. 5B). These data indicated that Glu439 might be a
preferential methylation site and Glu446 a potential sec-
ondary site for methylation. Our data demonstrated
that alanyl substitution on Glu439 or Glu446 significantly
impaired sB induction in the KNU802 strain. Therefore, we
expected that aspartyl substitution, mimicking demethyla-
tion of these residues, would result in relatively high levels
of sB even in the absence of stress. However, only basal
levels of sB were detected prior to 42°C exposure, and the
sB induction profile under heat stress was comparable to
that of the wild-type. These results imply that the lack of
methylation at any of these residues is insufficient to
cause sB activation.

Discussion

Multiple studies have demonstrated the roles of rsbV,
rsbW, sigB, rsbY and rsbK in sB regulation in B. cereus
(van Schaik et al., 2004; van Schaik et al., 2005; de Been
et al., 2010). In addition to these regulatory proteins, the
sigB gene cluster also encodes a dps-like bacterioferritin
(bc1005), dispensable for sB activity (Wang et al., 2009),
as well as bc1007 (Fig. 1A). In the present study, we
performed a genetic deletion study of bc1007 using
recombinant DNA methods and revealed that bc1007
deletion constitutively induced high levels of sB irrespec-
tive of heat stress, leading to increased viability relative to
the wild-type strain upon lethal heat exposure (Figs 1B
and 2A). These results signify the participation of BC1007

in sB regulation, but it may be argued that the high level of
sB expression could be caused either by bc1007 deletion
or due to an unexpected polarity. However, the high con-
stitutive sB activity was restored in KNU703 after the intro-
duction of the complementary plasmid pHT304-rsbK-
bc1007 (Figs 1C and 2A), and any interference of the
rsbY or rsbK genes flanking bc1007 should inactivate sB

(van Schaik et al., 2005; de Been et al., 2010). Thus, the
high constitutive expression of sB is simply a conse-
quence of the bc1007 knockout.

We were interested in understanding how BC1007
regulates sB activity. The bc1007 and rsbK genes have
been shown to be transcribed by a sA-dependent pro-
moter immediately upstream of rsbK, generating a poly-
cistronic mRNA (Fig. 1A). The architectural complexity of
the functional domains indicate that RsbK acts as a mul-
tiple hybrid sensor kinase, presumably regulating RsbY
through a TCS signalling pathway in response to external
and internal changes (de Been et al., 2011). BC1007 has
been proposed to display MCP methyltransferase activity
(de Been et al., 2011). In the original genome sequence of

B. cereus ATCC 14579 (Ivanova et al., 2003), the product
of bc1007 was annotated as a chemotaxis protein
methyltransferase (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/
1203356) with 28% and 29% identity with E. coli CheR
(GI:145523) and B. subtilis CheR (GI:143805) respec-
tively. BC1007 contains a conserved N-terminal all
alpha domain from Asn19 to Gly73 and a C-terminal SAM
binding domain from Asn85 to Arg263, based on the protein
domain information extracted from Pfam (Punta et al.,
2012, http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/protein/Q81H19). There-
fore, BC1007 potentially regulates sB through direct inter-
action with RsbK. This assumption is supported by two
lines of evidence: (i) the bacterial two-hybrid analysis
showed that BC1007 only interacted with RsbK and not
with RsbY (Fig. 3) or other regulators in the sigB cluster
(data not shown), and (ii) autoradiography showed that
the C14-methyl group(s) was specifically transferred from
radiolabelled SAM to RsbK when RsbK was incubated
with BC1007 (Fig. 4). Collectively, we conclude that
BC1007 is the cognate methyltransferase of RsbK and
functions as a negative regulator of sB.

methylation, and glutamate/glutamine with
aspartate mimics demethylation. The
constructed plasmids were transformed
separately into the Bacillus cereus strain
KNU802, and the resulting strains were
heated to 42°C for the indicated time periods.
Cellular extracts were subjected to Western
blot analysis.

We employed site-directed mutagenesis to determine
which residue(s) out of 12 putative methylation sites was
potentially methyl-modified under environmental stress.
As shown in Fig. 5B, most of the RsbK mutants were
capable of inducing sB expression (similar to the wild-
type RsbK), but with RsbKE439A, sB levels remained low,
suggesting that the Glu439 residue might be the prefer-
ential methylation site critical for sB control in vivo. In
contrast, alanyl substitution on Glu446 resulted in only
minimal sB repression. This attenuated sB activation due
to RsbKE446A could be explained by two hypotheses.
First, the residue substitution is not exactly the same
mechanistically as a methylated glutamyl residue,
although alanyl replacement eliminates the negative
charge of Glu446. Second, the residue change on Glu446

may neutralize the negative charge, creating a structural
constraint and thereby interfering with proper sB inhibi-
tion due to the close proximity of the Glu439 methylation
site. This explanation is plausible because methylation
sites have been reported to be spaced evenly at seven-
residue intervals on the same face of the a-helix where
they are accessible to the methyltransferase (Terwilliger
et al., 1986). Alanyl substitutions on Glu439 and Glu446

inhibited sB to different extents, but the expression of
RsbKE439D and RsbKE446D, which remain the predicted
methylatable Glu446 and Glu439 respectively, rescued sB

induction, similar to that observed in the wild-type strain
(Fig. 5B). These results suggest that methylation of any
of the methylatable sites may be sufficient to repress sB,
whereas methylation of one or more residues in RsbK
may occur in vivo. This pattern may reflect a subtle
methylation pattern in RsbK that fine tunes the level of
sB induction in response to various stimulation strengths
or distinct environmental stressors. In accordance with
this postulation, a previous study has shown B. cereus
treated with 2.5% NaCl to demonstrate a weak level of
sB activation compared with the bacteria receiving the
42°C heat stress treatment (de Been et al., 2010).
Although site-directed mutagenesis was employed at the
speculated methylatable positions in this study, substan-
tial techniques such as mass spectrometry need to be
used to reflect the in vivo methylation of wild-type RsbK
under physiological conditions because mutagenization
not only eliminates the putative methylatable residue but
also modifies the BC1007 recognition sequence.

Methylation of MCPs in bacterial TCSs is often asso-
ciated with sensory adaptation to diverse environmental
stimuli (Kirby, 2009). In E. coli, chemotaxis is mediated
by methylation, producing the increased kinase activity of
the MCP-associated CheA (Surette and Stock, 1996;
Glekas et al., 2011). Modulation of CheA activity through
the methylation of MCPs at given sites differentially regu-
lates chemotaxis in B. subtilis (Glekas et al., 2011) and
cellular development in Myxococcus xanthus (Scott

et al., 2008). Similar protein interactions have been
mechanistically linked to diverse cellular functions,
including intracellular levels of cyclic di-GMP, growth,
biofilm formation and cell development via functionally
and spatially distinct signalling pathways (D’Argenio
et al., 2002; Kirby and Zusman, 2003; Berleman and
Bauer, 2005; Tran et al., 2008). We demonstrate here for
the first time the successful activation of an alternative
transcription factor to be governed by BC1007, a CheR-
type methylatransferase. Although bc1007 encodes a
CheR-type methylatransferase, bc1007 is not relevant to
chemotaxis because deletion of bc1007 did not impair
the bacteria’s motility compared with the wild-type strain
(data not shown). Notably, multiple homologues of asso-
ciated methyltransferases (CheR) and methylesterases
(CheB) are found in other bacteria (Falke et al., 1997;
Martin et al., 2001; Kanungpean et al., 2011), but full
genome searches revealed no CheB homologues that
could be responsible for demethylation in B. cereus. The
mechanism of the relief of BC1007-mediated inhibition
remains unknown. Homodimers are known to be func-
tional units in a few chemoreceptors and histidine
kinases, and the HAMP domain signalling mechanisms
are likely intimately tied to this structural organization
(Parkinson, 2010). It would be interesting to know
whether RsbK forms a functional dimer as RsbK contains
a cytoplasmic HAMP domain. If so, is it possible that the
methyl group(s) of RsbK constitute(s) steric hindrances
destabilizing RsbK dimerization? In addition, in the
BC1007 deletion mutant, all RsbK methylation sites are
expected to be demethylated. As shown in Fig. 2A, this
demethylation leads to constitutive sB activation even
when there is no stress. Therefore, one may assume that
under non-stress conditions, a certain degree of RsbK
methylation keeps sB levels in check.

A previous study using genetic approaches suggested
that RsbK activates RsbY via either direct phosphoryl
transfer from the HK domain of RsbK to the REC domain
of RsbY or a multi-step phosphotransfer route in which
RsbK first transfers phosphoryl from its HK domain to its
own REC domain, after which phosphoryl is transferred to
the RsbY REC domain via a third phosphotransferase
protein (de Been et al., 2010). Our bacterial two-hybrid
results demonstrated a strong interaction between full-
length RsbK and RsbY (Fig. 1B and C), indicating that the
sB signalling pathway can be mediated by direct phospho-
transfer. Additionally, the RR-truncated RsbK retained a
weak interaction with RsbY, which may explain why the
expression of the RR-truncated RsbK elevated sB expres-
sion in the rsbK deletion strain but never reached the
maximum level (de Been et al., 2010). Our results indi-
cated that the REC domain is required for maintaining
RsbK in a proper conformation that allows RsbK interac-
tion with RsbY. Previously, the phosphorylation state

(D827) of the REC domain in RsbK has been proposed to
modulate the efficiency of phosphorelay (de Been et al.,
2010). Similar regulatory mechanisms have been shown
in other organisms, such as ArcB in E. coli (Iuchi, 1993)
and VsrB in Pseudomonas solanacearum (Huang et al.,
1993). A recent study suggested that the phosphorylation
of the C-terminal RR domains of VirA functions as an
activator to increase phosphotransfer from VirA to VirG in
Agrobacterium tumefaciens (Wise et al., 2010). The role
of the phosphorylation of D827 in the REC domain
requires further investigation.

Gene arrays of the rsbK orthologues and the neigh-
bouring rsbY and bc1007 orthologues were not restricted
to members of the B. cereus group but found in a wide
range of bacteria, suggesting that the RsbK-M-Y signal-
ling is a common regulatory strategy in bacteria (de Been
et al., 2011). In this study, two heptad segments enclose
RsbK potential methylation residue Glu439 and Glu446 may
play critical roles for sB control. We use sequence logo
(Crooks et al., 2004; http://weblogo.threeplusone.com/) to
describe the conserved pattern of these two heptads.
Homologue sequences were constructed from the
members in KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes) SSDB (Sequence Similarity DataBase) (Kane-
hisa et al., 2012) RsbK gene clusters, which are summa-
rized according to the orthologous relationship by both
sequence similarity and genome organization among
1490 Bacterial genomes, 118 Archaeal genomes, and
171 Eukaryotic genomes (in March 2012). In the highly
conserved orthologue gene cluster set, 127 RsbK-like
sequences are found in 10 bacteria phyla (Table S3) to
have BC1007 homologues as a close neighbour and
these two genes are arranged in the same orientation.
No orthologue was found in Archaea and Eukaryotes.
Although some sequences from Cyanobacteria,
Deinococcus-Thermus and Deltaproteobacteria show
poor alignment, all of these sequences retain the perfect
leucine residue repeat (one leucine per seven residues)
(Fig. S1A). As shown in the sequence logo (Fig. S1B),
residue composition of the ‘c’ position of potential methy-
lation site (e.g. Glu439) is highly conserved, and the overall
composition of first heptad (Glu439 enclosed heptad) is
more conserved than the second heptad containing
Glu446.

In summary, our results indicate that the methylation
of RsbK by a CheR-like methyltransferase BC1007
(renamed RsbM: Regulator of sigmaB Methyltransferase)
could inhibit sB activation in the absence of stress. When
a stress signal occurs, the activated RsbK propagates the
signal to downstream regulators (RsbY, RsbV, RsbW) to
release and activate sB (Fig. 6). This finding expands our
understanding of the common RsbK-M-Y module that
controls a diverse array of signalling networks, particularly
those containing sB-like stress factors.

Experimental procedures

Bacterial strains and plasmids

The genotypes and sources of the bacterial strains and plas-
mids used in this study are listed in Table S1. Bacillus cereus
(ATCC 14579) was grown in brain heart infusion (BHI)
medium at 30°C, and E. coli was cultured in Luria-Bertani
(LB) medium at 37°C. The E. coli strains DH5-a, XL-1 blue
and BL21 (lDE3) were used for plasmid manipulation and
IPTG-induced expression. The growth of the cultures was
monitored by measuring the optical density at 600 nm
(OD600). The antibiotic selection used for cloning and mutant
screening was performed with ampicillin (50 mg ml-1), eryth-
romycin (3 mg ml-1), and spectinomycin (100 mg ml-1), as
required.

Fig. 6. Models for sB activation in Bacillus cereus. In the absence
of stress, sB is maintained inactive in a complex with its anti-sigma
factor RsbW, which also inactivates RsbV by phosphorylation
through its kinase activity. RsbM (BC1007) methylates RsbK on
residues Glu439 and Glu446 and thereby inhibits sB activity. If
stimulated by specific stress signals, RsbK is activated, and the
phosphate directly transferred from the H-box of RsbK to the REC
domain of RsbY or indirectly transferred through a multi-step
phosphotransfer route in which RsbK first transfers phosphoryl from
its HK domain to its own REC domain, after which phosphoryl is
transferred to the REC domain of RsbY via a third
histidine-containing phosphotransferase (Hpt) protein (de Been
et al., 2010). This action enhances the phosphatase activity of
RsbY to hydrolyse RsbV-P. The RsbW : sB complex is disrupted the
dephosphorylated RsbV because RsbW forms an alternative
complex with RsbV (dashed arrows). Free sB can now interact with
RNA polymerase and induce direct transcription of the
SigB-dependent general stress response genes.

Bacterial two-hybrid assay

Bacterial two-hybrid analysis of protein interactions was per-
formed as previously described (Karimova et al., 1998). To
construct recombinant plasmids for use in bacterial two-
hybrid analysis, rsbY, bc1007, rsbK and C-terminal truncated
rsbK were amplified by PCR using specific oligonucleotide
primers (Table S2). The amplicons, bc1007, rsbK and
C-terminal truncated rsbK, were individually cloned in-frame
into the multiple cloning site of pUT18. The amplicons, rsbY
and bc1007, were cloned into pKT25 individually. Comple-
mentation of protein pairs (Fig. 3) was indicated by blue
colony growth on LB plates containing X-gal, by blue colony
growth on M63-defined medium/maltose containing 0.5 mM
IPTG and 40 mg ml-1 X-gal or by red colony growth on
MacConkey-maltose agar. Both media contained ampicillin
and kanamycin to select for the inserted plasmids. The plates
were incubated at 30°C for a maximum of 40 h. The pKT25-
zip and pUT18-zip plasmids were used as positive controls
for protein interaction, and the empty vectors pKT25 and
pUT18 were used as negative controls.

Construction of bc1007 and rsbK null strains

Gene deletion of bc1007 and rsbK was performed as
previously described (Arnaud et al., 2004). To produce the
pMAD-Dbc1007 plasmid, two DNA fragments of 800 bp and
1041 bp, corresponding to the regions located directly
upstream and downstream of bc1007 respectively, were
amplified by PCR using B. cereus genomic DNA as the tem-
plate. Using restriction enzymes, these DNA fragments were
cloned into the pMAD vector on either side of a DNA fragment
(1221 bp) that was amplified by PCR from pDG1728. Simi-
larly, a 739 bp DNA fragment, beginning 424 bp upstream of
rsbK and continuing through 315 bp of the 5′ coding region,
and an additional 1411 bp DNA fragment, beginning at
447 bp of the 3′ end and ending 964 bp downstream of rsbK,
were amplified from B. cereus genomic DNA. To generate
pMAD-DrsbK, the coding region of the spectinomycin resis-
tance gene (750 bp) was inserted in-frame into the above
DNA fragments. Oligonucleotide primers used are shown in
Table S2, and the plasmid map is indicated in Fig. 1B. Both
the pMAD-Dbc1007 and pMAD-DrsbK plasmids were intro-
duced into B. cereus by electroporation at 1.7 kV in 1 cm
electrocuvettes (Eppendorf). Transformants were obtained
after culturing for 2 days at 30°C on BHI plates containing
spectinomycin, erythromycin, and X-gal. A pool of individual
transformants was used to inoculate a culture of BHI medium
without antibiotics, and this culture was then incubated at
40°C until the stationary phase of growth was reached. Two
additional growth cycles were performed by diluting the sta-
tionary phase culture into fresh media, and single colonies
were isolated by plating dilutions of the culture overnight onto
BHI plates containing X-gal and spectinomycin. Several white
colonies were also isolated to verify the erythromycin-
sensitive phenotype. DNA was purified from several clones
and analysed by PCR using oligonucleotides that hybridized
outside of the inserts to verify the presence of the deletion
and the insertion of the spectinomycin resistance gene. Gene
deletion was also confirmed by Southern blot. The bc1007
and rsbK deletion mutant strains were named KNU701 and
KNU802 respectively.

Construction of pHT304-rsbK-bc1007 and
pHT304-rsbKm-bc1007

A DNA fragment (2255 bp) containing a partial sequence
from bc1009 and internal to rsbK with the endogenous
BamHI site was amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA of
B. cereus using the Restore-up-SmaI-F and Restore-up-
BamHI-R primers (Table S2). Another DNA fragment
(1782 bp), which included the rest of rsbK and full-length
bc1007, was amplified with the Restore-do-BamHI-F and
Restore-do-PstI-R primers (Table S2). Both DNA fragments
were then inserted into pHT304 to generate pHT304-rsbK-
bc1007 (Fig. 1C). Complementation of the bc1007 mutation
found in strain KNU701 was performed by introduction into
the plasmid pHT304-rsbK-bc1007, thus generating strain
KNU703. The plasmid control (mock) strain KNU702 was
generated by introducing the pHT304 plasmid into the
KNU701 strain.

Site-directed mutagenesis was performed as previously
described (Ho et al., 1989; Kanoksilapatham et al., 2007),
with slight modifications to generate the vector carrying the
mutagenic rsbK, pHT304-rsbKm-bc1007. A standard PCR
reaction (50 ml) was conducted in Phusion™ GC buffer con-
taining pHT304-rsbK-bc1007 (30 ng) as the template and 1 U
Phusion™ high-fidelity DNA polymerase (NEB) in 3% DMSO
using the primer pairs listed in Table S2. The PCR product
was digested with the DpnI restriction enzyme to cleave the
methylated pHT304-rsbK-bc1007 template and then trans-
formed into the E. coli XL-1 blue strain. The mutagenized
plasmid was extracted, and the mutations were confirmed by
DNA sequencing.

Construction of pET21b-rsbK and
pET21b-rsbK-bc1007-6xHis

The entire rsbK coding region was PCR amplified from the
genomic DNA of B. cereus using the primers pET21b-rsbK-
NdeI-F and pET21b-rsbK-XhoI-R. The PCR product was
digested by NdeI and XhoI and cloned into the plasmid
pET21b to generate the plasmid pET21b-rsbK (Table S1). In
addition, the full-length reading frame of the rsbK-bc1007
operon with the deletion of the stop codon was cloned into the
expression vector pET21b to construct pET21b-rsbK-
bc1007-6xHis (Table S1). For this purpose, the DNA frag-
ment from the first codon of rsbK to the region containing the
only intrinsic BamHI restriction site of rsbK and another DNA
fragment from the intrinsic BamHI restriction site to the ter-
minator of bc1007, were amplified with primer pairs with
restriction sites introduced (Table S2). Subsequently, the two
PCR products were digested with NdeI/BamHI and BamHI/
XhoI respectively, and inserted into pET21b.

Western blot

Bacillus cereus and the engineered derivatives were grown in
BHI broth at 30°C with aeration until an OD600 of 0.5 was
reached. They were then incubated at 42°C for 10, 20 and
30 min. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation and imme-
diately frozen in liquid nitrogen. The cells were subsequently
disrupted by sonication. Cell extracts (30 mg) were separated

by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose mem-
branes. The membranes were probed with 1:5000 dilutions of
anti-sB, anti-Dps-like bacterioferritin (BC1005), and anti-
EF-TU (BC0129) polyclonal antisera in PBS-Tween at room
temperature for 1 h with gentle agitation. The membranes
were then incubated with a secondary antibody (HRP-
conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG). For the detection of His-
tagged RsbK expression in E. coli, the membranes were
blotted with a 1:2000 dilution of an anti-His tag monoclonal
antibody followed by incubation with a secondary antibody
(HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG). Enhanced chemilu-
minescence detection reagents were added to develop the
images.

Cell viability experiments

Wild-type B. cereus and KNU701 strains were cultured until
an OD600 of 0.5 was reached, and the cells were exposed to
a lethal temperature of 50°C by shifting the whole cell culture
flask from a 30°C to a 50°C water bath, causing a gradual
increase in the temperature. Samples from each bacterial
culture (100 ml) were taken at the indicated time points (0, 5,
10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 min), streaked onto BHI agar plates at
the appropriate dilutions and incubated overnight at 30°C.
Cell survival was assessed by counting the colony number
and cell viability for each time point. The results were calcu-
lated from at least three independent experiments.

Protein overexpression and purification

For the purification of BC1007, E. coli BL21 (lDE3) cells
were transformed with pET21b-rsbK-bc1007. Transformed
cells were inoculated in 250 ml of LB medium containing
50 mg ml-1 ampicillin and grown at 37°C with vigorous
shaking. At an OD600 of 0.6, protein expression was induced
for 3 h by adding IPTG (isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside)
to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. Subsequently, the culture
was chilled over ice, and the cells were harvested. The
recombinant His6-fused BC1007 protein was then purified.
Briefly, harvested cells were suspended in 30 ml of cell lysis
buffer [50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.5), 10 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT
and 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride] and sonicated.
Soluble proteins were separated from the cell debris by cen-
trifugation at 15 000 g for 30 min at 4°C, and the supernatant
was passed through a 0.22 mm filter (Millipore) and loaded
onto a nickel column (GE Healthcare). Bound proteins were
eluted according to the manufacturer’s instruction.

In vitro methylation assay

For the overproduction of RsbK, E. coli BL21 (lDE3) cells
were transformed with pET21b-rsbK. As described previ-
ously, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 g for
10 min at 4°C after IPTG induction, washed with cold PBS
and then re-suspended with methylation buffer [50 mM
Hepes (pH 8.0), 0.01% (v/v) NP-40, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT,
1 mM PMSF]. The collected cells were disrupted by sonica-
tion to prepare whole cell lysates, and 100 mg of each cell
lysate was incubated with purified recombinant BC1007
protein in 45 ml of methylation buffer supplemented with

500 nCi of S-adenosyl-L-(methyl-14C) methionine (14C-SAM;
61 mCi mmol-1, GE Healthcare) (radioactive methylation) for
1 h at room temperature. The reactions were stopped by
adding 3 ¥ 10% SDS-PAGE sample buffer [187.5 mM Tris-
HCl, 6% (w/v) SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.03% (w/v) bromophenol
blue, 1.25 M DTT, pH 6.8] followed by heating at 95°C for
10 min. The samples were analysed by 12% SDS-PAGE and
stained with Coomassie blue. The gel was treated with
Amplify Fluorographic Reagent (GE Healthcare) for 30 min,
according to the manufacturer’s instruction, and dried by
vacuum. The radioactivity was visualized by exposing the gel
to an X-ray film at -80°C for 1 week.

Analysis of conservation of putative methylation sites
in RsbK-like proteins

To further describe the conserved pattern of the putative
RsbK methylation sites, we collect B. cererus RsbK ortho-
logue from KEGG SSDB (Kanehisa et al., 2012) for conclud-
ing the consensus signature. In order to avoid the bias of
concluding methylation site consensus pattern from an over-
representative species with multiple RsbK sequences in the
dataset, one sequence was picked for a single species
regardless of strain diversity. Totally 79 sequences from Pro-
teobacteria (48 seqs), Firmicutes (15 seqs), Actinobacteria
(two seqs), Spirochaetes (two seqs), Bacteroidetes (nine
seqs), Cyanobacteria (one seq) and Deinococcus-Thermus
(two seqs), were used in this study (Table S3). Peptide
sequence segments corresponding to the T421-K495 were
identified by multiple sequence alignment (msa) using by
Parallel PRRN in GenomeNet (Gotoh, 1995) and extended to
include 10 more residues in N′ end. The final msa for the
methylation sites are performed by ClustalW (Larkin et al.,
2007) with ‘slow/accurate algorithm’ and ‘iterate each
alignment steps’. The sequence logo of potential methylation
sites of RsbK family members are constructed from msa
alignment by WebLogo 3.2 (Crooks et al., 2004, http://
weblogo.threeplusone.com/) with a colour scheme to show
the chemistry property of residues. Both the signature of
Firmicutes sequences and of all 10 phyla sequences were
concluded.

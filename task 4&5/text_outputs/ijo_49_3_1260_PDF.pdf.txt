following the publication of the above article, an interested 
reader drew an anomaly associated with the presentation of 
fig. 7 to our attention. essentially, the panel showing the 
cis 0.001 data at t0 for the brc-230 cell line was the same as 
that showing the cis 0.01 data.

after having re-examined our data, we realized that an error 
must have occurred when preparing fig. 7. a duplication of the 
photo corresponding to brc-230 cis 0.001 t0 was incorrectly 
placed in the position corresponding to brc-230 cis 0.01 t0, 
while the correct BRC-230 Cis 0.01 T0 figure was erroneously 
positioned in the brc-230 cis 0.01 t1 slot. fortunately, we had  
retained all of the data on our computer and were able to find the 
correct photos representing the conditions of brc-230 cis 0.01 
t0 and t1.

The correct version of Fig. 7 is shown below. The findings 
and conclusions of this paper are still supported by our 
experimental data and are not affected by this error. We sincerely 
apologize for this oversight and thank the reader for drawing 
this matter to our attention. We regret any inconvenience caused 
by our mistake.

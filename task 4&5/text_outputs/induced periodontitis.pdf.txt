1  | INTRODUC TION

Periodontitis is a prevalent chronic inflammatory bone loss dis-
ease affecting 47% of adults in the United States (Eke et al., 2012). 
It is initiated by formation of dysbiotic bacterial colonies on sub-
gingival mucosa (Darveau, 2010; Hajishengallis & Lambris, 2012), 
resulting in release of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, 

TNF-α, and RANKL. Enhanced levels of inflammatory cytokines 
subsequently recruit monocytes and macrophages to gingival 
tissues. These mononuclear cells can further differentiate and 
fuse to form multinucleated osteoclasts, resulting in destruction 
of alveolar bone tissues and subsequent tooth loss. Periodontitis 
can also influence systemic health, as severe periodontitis is as-
sociated with increased risk of other systemic diseases, such

Abstract
Objectives: Periodontitis is an inflammatory bone loss disease initiated by oral bacte-
rial inflammation. Herein, we determined whether inhibition of sphingosine-1-phos-
phate receptor 2 (S1PR2, a G protein-coupled receptor) by its specific antagonist, 
JTE013, could alleviate ligature-induced periodontitis in mice.
Materials and Methods: C57BL/6 mice were placed with silk ligatures at the left 
maxillary second molar to induce experimental periodontitis. Mice were treated with 
JTE013 or control vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO) oral topically on the ligatures 
once daily. After 15 days of treatment, RNA was extracted from the lingual mucosal 
tissues to quantify IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF mRNA levels in the tissues. Alveolar bone loss 
was determined by micro-computed tomography. Sagittal periodontal tissue sec-
tions were cut and stained by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for general histology, or 
stained by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) for osteoclasts.
Results: Treatment with JTE013 attenuated ligature-induced alveolar bone loss com-
pared with DMSO treatment. Treatment with JTE013 reduced IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF 
mRNA levels in murine gingival mucosal tissues, inhibited leukocyte infiltration in the 
periodontal tissues, and decreased the number of osteoclasts in the periodontal tis-
sues compared with controls.
Conclusion: Oral topical administration of JTE013 alleviated periodontal inflamma-
tory bone loss induced by ligature placement in mice.

as atherosclerosis, diabetes, stroke, and compilations of preg-
nancy (Genco & Van Dyke, 2010; Jeffcoat et al., 2014; Pihlstrom 
et al., 2005).

Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2) is a G pro-
tein-coupled receptor, which is expressed in most tissues (Aarthi 
et al., 2011; Kluk & Hla, 2002). It is expressed on the plasma mem-
brane and in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells (Aarthi et al., 2011; 
Kluk & Hla, 2002). S1PR2 couples with the Gi, Gq, and G12/13 fam-
ily of proteins, which regulate multiple signaling pathways, includ-
ing Rho, Rac, phospholipase C, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), 
NF-κB, and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (Aarthi 
et al., 2011; Kluk & Hla, 2002; Siehler et al., 2002; Takuwa, 2002; 
Yu, 2016).

Our previous studies showed that S1PR2 not only regulates 
S1P signaling, but also controls the inflammatory response stim-
ulated by an oral bacterial pathogen, Aggregatibacter actinomyce-
temcomitans (Aa) (Hsu et al., 2019; Yu, 2016). Treatment with a 
specific S1PR2 shRNA or the S1PR2-specific inhibitor (JTE013) 
reduced IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α cytokine levels stimulated by Aa 
in murine bone marrow-derived monocytes and macrophages 
(BMMs) compared with controls (Hsu et al., 2019; Yu, 2016). 
Additionally, treatment with the S1PR2 shRNA or JTE013 inhibited 
cell chemotaxis stimulated by filter-sterilized cell culture media 
derived from BMMs infected with Aa (Hsu et al., 2019; Yu, 2016). 
Mechanistically, we determined that S1PR2 modulates PI3K, NF-
κB, and MAPK protein kinases induced by Aa, subsequently affect-
ing IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α release, and cell chemotaxis response (Hsu 
et al., 2019; Yu, 2016).

S1PR2 not only controls inflammatory cytokine response initi-
ated by bacterial pathogens, it also regulates bacterial phagocytosis. 
For instance, a previous study demonstrated that S1PR2 suppresses 
bacterial phagocytosis (Hou et al., 2015). They discovered that 
S1PR2 inhibits Rac1 activation induced by Escherichia coli (E. coli), 
subsequently leading to reduced filamentous actin (F-actin) polym-
erization and decreased bacterial phagocytosis (Hou et al., 2015). In 
addition, they showed that intratracheal instillation of the S1PR2-
specific antagonist, JTE013 (4 mg/kg), improved survival rate in mice 
challenged by a lethal dose of E. coli. Treatment with JTE013 reduced 
the bacterial load in the blood and in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 
compared with vehicle treatment. This study demonstrated that 
treatment with JTE013 alleviated bacterial infection by enhancing 
bacterial phagocytosis.

Furthermore, S1PR2 plays a key role in osteoclastogenesis and 
bone resorption stimulated by RANKL. Oral bacterial pathogens 
induce the generation of RANKL. RANKL, the critical cytokine for 
osteoclastogenesis, promotes mononuclear monocytes to fuse and 
form multinucleated osteoclasts, resulting in bone destruction and 
alveolar bone loss associated with periodontitis (Vaananen & Laitala-
Leinonen, 2008). In the process of osteoclastogenesis, RANKL 
activates podosome components, which are cell adhesive units, 
consisting of F-actin, integrins, integrin-associated proteins, and 
protein kinases (PI3K, Src, and Pyk2) (Linder & Aepfelbacher, 2003). 
Increased levels of podosome components stimulated by RANKL 

lead to adhesion and fusion of mononuclear cells to form osteo-
clasts. Our previous study (Hsu et al., 2019) demonstrated that 
S1PR2 modulates podosome components induced by RANKL, 
subsequently influencing osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption. 
Murine bone marrow cells treated with either the S1PR2 shRNA or 
the S1PR2-specific inhibitor, JTE013, reduced these podosome com-
ponents induced by RANKL. As a result, treatment with the S1PR2 
shRNA or JTE013 inhibited osteoclastogenesis and suppressed bone 
resorption stimulated by RANKL (Hsu et al., 2019; Yu, 2016).

Herein, we used a ligature-induced experimental periodontitis 
model to determine whether treatment with the S1PR2-specific in-
hibitor, JTE013, in mice can reduce inflammatory cytokine release 
in gingival tissues, decrease leukocyte infiltration in the periodontal 
tissues, inhibit osteoclastogenesis, and alleviate alveolar bone loss 
induced by ligature placement compared with vehicle DMSO treat-
ment in mice. This ligature model is widely used to initiate experi-
mental periodontitis in different animals, including mice, rats, dogs, 
and non-human primates (Abe & Hajishengallis, 2013; Glowacki 
et al., 2013; Kajikawa et al., 2017; Weiner et al., 1979).

2  | MATERIAL S AND METHODS

2.1 | Animals and reagents

The S1PR2-specific antagonist (JTE013) was obtained from Cayman 
Chemical and dissolved in DMSO (20 mg/ml). Eight-week-old male 
C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. Mice were 
housed under a 12-hr light/12-hr dark cycle in specific pathogen-
free conditions and had free access to food and water. All animal-
related work was conducted in accordance with the guidelines laid 
down by the National Institute of Health (NIH) in the United States 
regarding the use of animals for experimental procedures, and ap-
proved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the 
Medical University of South Carolina.

2.2 | Animal treatment

To induce inflammatory bone loss, a 5.0 silk suture (Roboz Surgical 
Instrument Co.) was tied around the cervical region of left maxillary 
second molars of all the mice under isoflurane anesthesia. The right 
maxillary teeth were untreated to serve as a baseline control for 
bone volume measurements. Animals were divided into two groups 
(10 mice/group). Previous studies (Hou et al., 2015; Ishii et al., 2010) 
used 3–4 mg/kg of JTE013 in mice. Considering that JTE013 would 
be diluted in the oral cavity as a result of mice drinking water, we 
chose a 5 mg/kg dose. In the experimental group, mice were admin-
istered the S1PR2-specific antagonist (JTE013, 5 mg/kg, 20 mg/ml, 
13–16 µl) topically on the ligature under isoflurane anesthesia once 
daily. In the control group, mice were treated in the same way with 
an equal volume of vehicle (DMSO). The ligatures were checked daily 
and remained in place in all mice during the experimental period. 



     |  1285SNIPES Et al.

To promote persistent inflammation and osteoclastogenesis, we re-
placed all the ligatures on day 7 and day 11 to induce minor tissue 
injury and persistent inflammatory bone loss response.

After treatment with JTE013 or DMSO for 15 days, mice were 
euthanized. Both left and right lingual oral mucosal tissues (5 mice/
group) were harvested and stored in TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific). Both sides of maxillary tissues (10 mice/group) were fixed 
in 10% buffered formalin solution for 48 hr. After fixation, the tis-
sues were stored in 70% ethanol.

2.3 | Micro-computed tomography (µ-CT) 
scanning and alveolar bone loss assessment

Both sides of animal maxillae were scanned by a cone-beam µ-CT40 
system (Scanco Medical AG, Switzerland). Three-dimensional µ-CT 
images were analyzed by the GE Healthcare MicroView software. 
The alveolar bone volume around the second molar was calculated 
within a region of interest (ROI). The width of the ROI was equal 
to the length between the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) of the 1st 
molar and the 3rd molar. The height of ROI was equal to the distance 
from molar cusp tips to root apices of the 2nd molar. The depth of 
ROI was equal to the buccal–lingual width of the 2nd molar plus 0.3 
mm3. To determine the bone volume in the ROI, bone volume frac-
tion (BVF) was calculated as follows: BVF = bone volume ÷ total vol-
ume of ROI.

2.4 | Tissue processing, staining, and 
pathological assessment

Maxillary bone tissues were decalcified in a 20% EDTA solution for 
four weeks followed by paraffin embedding. Five-micrometer sagit-
tal paraffin tissue sections were cut, stained with hematoxylin and 
eosin (H&E) for general histology, or stained by tartrate-resistant 
acid phosphatase (TRAP) for osteoclasts as previously described 
(Yu et al., 2016). Inflammation in the periodontal tissues was scored 
by an experienced pathologist who was blinded to the treatment 
groups. Inflammatory criteria were defined as follows: 0, there was 
an absence of inflammatory cells in the periodontal tissues, and no 
indication of fibroblast proliferation or alveolar bone destruction; 1, 
inflammatory cells were focally infiltrated in the periodontal tissues 
and the total number of inflammatory cells was less than 100 per 
section, mild fibroblast proliferation and bone destruction were pre-
sent; 2, inflammatory cells were diffusely infiltrated in the periodon-
tal tissues, with a total number of 100–200 inflammatory cells per 
section, and moderate fibroblast proliferation and bone destruction 
were present; and 3, inflammatory cells were diffusely infiltrated 
in the periodontal tissues, with the total number of inflammatory 
cells above 200 per section, with profound fibroblast proliferation 
and bone destruction present. The number of multinucleated TRAP-
stained osteoclasts surrounding alveolar bone was also evaluated by 
the pathologist.

2.5 | RNA extraction and real-time PCR

Oral tissues were homogenized in TRIzol by a bullet blender tis-
sue homogenizer (Next Advance, Inc.) with RNase-free stainless 
steel beads. Total RNA was extracted, and complementary DNA 
was synthesized by a TaqMan Reverse Transcription Reagent 
(Applied Biosystems). The real-time PCR was conducted using a 
StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) as pre-
viously described (Yu et al., 2011). The following primers were 
purchased from Applied Biosystems: IL-1β (Mm00434228_m1), 
IL-6 (Mm00446190_m1), TNF (Mm00443258_m1), and GAPDH 
(Mm99999915_g1). Sample mRNA levels were normalized to con-
trol GAPDH expression and were expressed as fold changes as 
compared with control groups.

2.6 | Statistical analysis

Mucosal inflammatory cytokine levels, micro-CT alveolar bone vol-
ume fraction, and the number of osteoclasts in periodontal tissue 
sections were analyzed by the paired t test to compare ligature side 
with control side in the same group of animals. We also analyzed 
these parameters using the unpaired t test to compare the JTE013-
treated group with the DMSO-treated group in different animals. 
Inflammation scores were analyzed using Wilcoxon matched-pairs 
signed rank test to compare ligature side and control side in the 
same group of animals. The Mann–Whitney test was used to com-
pare the inflammation score between the JTE013-treated group and 
the DMSO-treated group in different animals. Data were expressed 
as means ± standard deviation (SD). p-values less than 0.05 were 
considered significant.

3  | RESULTS

3.1 | Treatment with JTE013 attenuated alveolar 
bone loss induced by ligature placement in mice

To evaluate the potential for JTE013 treatment to protect against 
inflammatory bone loss in mice, the volume of alveolar bone was 
quantified from the µCT scans. In the absence of ligature place-
ment, there was no significant bone loss observed in animals 
treated with either DMSO or JTE013 (Figure 1a). By contrast, se-
vere alveolar bone loss was observed when ligatures were placed 
in mice and treated with DMSO, focused mainly around the 2nd 
molar and some in the 1st and 3rd molar regions. Since the alveolar 
bone loss affected the alveolar bone from the 1st molar to the 3rd 
molar, we created a standard box (Figure 1b) to evaluate alveolar 
bone loss in the standard box using bone volume fraction (BVF). 
In animals treated with DMSO with ligature placement, there 
was an average reduction of BVF of 0.1. In contrast, in animals 
treated with JTE013 with ligature placement, there was an aver-
age reduction of BVF of 0.06, a 40% of decrease of alveolar bone

loss induced by ligature placement compared with vehicle treat-
ment. Oral topical administration of JTE013 once daily for 15 days 
significantly attenuated alveolar bone loss compared with DMSO 
treatment (n = 10, ***p < .001).

3.2 | JTE013 decreased IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF mRNA 
levels in periodontal mucosal tissues induced by 
ligature placement in mice

Since oral bacterial pathogens stimulate the release of inflamma-
tory cytokine (such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF), resulting in periodon-
tal inflammation and subsequent alveolar bone loss, we determined 
whether inhibition of S1PR2 by JTE013 could reduce these inflam-
matory effects. Placement of ligature at the left maxillary 2nd molar 
significantly increased the mRNA levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF com-
pared with the right side without ligature placement (Figure 2a–c). 
The fold increases were 3.0 for IL-1β, 4.8 for IL-6, and 3.5 for TNF, 
respectively. Treatment with JTE013 significantly reduced these 
mRNA levels compared with DMSO treatment in mice both with 

and without the ligature placement. In the left lingual mucosal tis-
sues with ligature placement, JTE013-treated animals reduced IL-1β 
by 69.4%, IL-6 by 84.6%, and TNF by 79.1%, respectively, compared 
with DMSO-treated animals (Figure 2d). In the right lingual mucosal 
tissues without ligature placement, JTE013-treated animals de-
creased IL-1β by 76.1%, IL-6 by 58.6%, and TNF by 85.4%, respec-
tively, compared with DMSO-treated animals.

3.3 | Treatment with JTE013 reduced periodontal 
inflammation in periodontal tissues induced by 
ligature placement in mice

Since inflammatory cytokines chemoattract leukocytes in the peri-
odontal tissues, we also determined whether JTE013 treatment af-
fected periodontal leukocyte infiltration after ligature placement. 
Pathological evaluation of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of 
maxillary periodontal tissues revealed that the alveolar bone surface 
was smooth, with no indication of inflammation in periodontal tis-
sues of mice treated with either DMSO or JTE013 without ligature

placement (Figure 3). By contrast, in mice with ligature placement 
and treated with DMSO, infiltration of polymorphonuclear leuko-
cytes and mononuclear leukocyte was observed in the periodontal 
tissues. In addition, many proliferative fibroblasts were observed in 
stromal tissues, and the alveolar bone appeared as irregular pieces. 
The average inflammation score in tissues with ligature placement 
and treated with DMSO was 2.47. In contrast, in mice with ligature 
placement and treated with JTE013, there was a significant reduc-
tion in leukocyte infiltration of the periodontal tissues. The average 
inflammation score in these tissues was 1.70, a significant reduction 
compared with DMSO control (n = 10, *p < .05).

3.4 | Treatment with JTE013 decreased the 
number of osteoclasts in periodontal tissue induced 
by ligature placement in mice

To evaluate whether JTE013 treatment could impact osteoclas-
togenesis in periodontal tissues derived from the experimental 
mice, we stained tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) for 
osteoclasts in maxillary tissues. In mice without ligature placement, 
no TRAP-stained osteoclasts were observed in periodontal tissues 
treated with JTE013 (Figure 4) and few osteoclasts (1–3 per sec-
tion) were observed in periodontal tissues treated with DMSO. In 

mice treated with DMSO and with ligature placement, many TRAP-
stained osteoclasts were observed (average 78 osteoclasts per sec-
tion) surrounding the alveolar bone tissues. In contrast, for mice 
treated with JTE013 with ligature placement, a significant reduction 
of the number of osteoclasts (average 41 osteoclasts per section, 
a 52.6% reduction) surrounding the alveolar bone tissues was ob-
served (n = 10, *p < .05).

4  | DISCUSSION

Herein, we demonstrate the efficacy of a S1PR2-specific inhibitor, 
JTE013, for alleviating inflammatory bone loss in vivo. Oral topi-
cal administration of JTE013 (5 mg/kg) once daily for 15 days sig-
nificantly reduced alveolar bone loss induced by ligature placement 
compared with control vehicle (DMSO) treatment. Treatment with 
JTE013 decreased IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF mRNA levels in the oral mu-
cosa tissues; alleviated the degree of periodontal inflammation; and 
decreased the number of osteoclasts in periodontal tissues com-
pared with DMSO treatment. These results are in accordance with 
our previous in vitro studies, which showed that JTE013 inhibited 
IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF protein levels stimulated by the oral pathogen 
Aa, as well as suppressed osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption 
induced by RANKL in murine bone marrow cells (Hsu et al., 2019;

Yu, 2016). These findings are also similar to a previous study, 
which demonstrated that mice pretreated with JTE013 (1.2 mg/
kg) reduced serum IL-1β and IL-18 levels induced by LPS (Skoura 
et al., 2011). Furthermore, since the previous study (Hou et al., 2015) 
revealed that JTE013 promotes bacterial phagocytosis and reduces 
bacterial burden of E. coli, JTE013 might reduce the amount of bac-
terial colonization around the ligatures, and attenuate IL-1β, IL-6, and 
TNF in the oral mucosa. Our study results are also in consistent with 
another previous study (Ishii et al., 2010), which demonstrated that 
JTE013 (3 mg/kg) treatment alleviated osteoporosis in mice induced 
by RANKL.

Our previous in vitro study (Hsu et al., 2019) showed that 
JTE013 (8 µM, about 3.2 µg/ml) reduced IL-1β by 90.2%, IL-6 by 
80.8%, and TNF-α by 49.5% induced by the oral pathogen Aa com-
pared with the vehicle-treated controls. JTE013 (8 µM) reduced 
the number of osteoclasts by 95.3% in bone marrow cells stim-
ulated with RANKL and by 83.7% in cells co-cultured with both 
RANKL and Aa-stimulated cell culture media compared with the 
control vehicle group. In the current in vivo study, we adminis-
tered JTE013 (20 mg/ml, 13–16 µl, about 260 to 320 µg) on the 
ligatures once daily, which reduced IL-1β by 69.4%, IL-6 by 84.6%, 
and TNF by 79.1%, respectively, induced by the ligature placement 
on the left side gingival mucosa compared with vehicle treatment. 

Treatment with JTE013 decreased the average number of osteo-
clasts by 52.6% and reduced the alveolar bone loss by 40% com-
pared with vehicle treatment. Although we used a higher dose of 
JTE013 compared with the dose in our previous in vitro studies, 
JTE013 did not completely suppress alveolar bone loss induced 
by ligature placement. This might be caused by the following rea-
sons: (a) JTE013 concentration in the oral cavity can be diluted 
by drinking water or eating food in mice, and (b) JTE013 was only 
administered once daily. Although ligatures might play a role in 
retention of JTE013 in the oral cavity, JTE013 concentration in the 
oral cavity could be diluted to below 8 µM in the oral cavity after 
a long period of time (such as several hours). There was a limita-
tion in this study to determine the JTE013 concentration in the 
oral mucosa tissues of mice by chemical analysis. Future study is 
needed to determine the JTE013 concentration in the oral mucosa 
tissues, and if multiple oral topical administration of JTE013 could 
further decrease inflammatory cytokine production, inhibit osteo-
clastogenesis, and reduce alveolar bone loss induced by ligature 
placement in animals.

In the current study, low levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF mRNA 
were detected in the right side of lingual mucosa tissues even 
without ligature placement. This could be because of the smaller 
spaces between teeth in mice compared to those in larger animals,

such as rats. Therefore, ligature placement in mice causes mu-
cosa damage, bacterial colonization, and severe inflammation, 
which can impact the cytokine levels in the contralateral lingual 
mucosa tissues. Inhibition of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 
2 by JTE013 significantly suppressed the inflammatory cytokine 
production on both sides (Figure 2). A previous study (Marchesan 
et al., 2018) showed that long-term (12 to 18 days) ligature place-
ment significantly enhanced alveolar bone loss compared with 
short-term (3 to 6 days) ligature placement. However, the number 
of osteoclasts and inflammatory cells in the periodontal tissues 
was significantly reduced in the long-term ligature placement 
groups compared with short-term ligature placement (Marchesan 
et al., 2018). In the current study, we replaced all the ligatures at 
day 7 and day 11, which resulted in mild mucosal injury, bacterial 
colonization, and persistent chronic inflammatory response in the 
periodontal tissues. Therefore, infiltration of leukocytes and os-
teoclasts can be observed in the periodontal tissues 15 days after 
ligature placement.

Current treatments for patients with periodontitis include scal-
ing and root planing to remove the bacterial plaque and calculus; 
antibiotic treatment to reduce or eliminate microbial pathogens; and 
in severe cases, surgical procedures to reduce or eliminate periodon-
tal pockets. Despite the current treatment modalities, periodontitis 

is still the major causes of alveolar bone loss and tooth loss in adults 
(Batista et al., 2012; Eke et al., 2012). Additionally, long-term antibi-
otic treatment not only kills oral pathogens, but also eradicates good 
bacteria, which sometimes leads to severe effects, such as pseudo-
membranous colitis.

Oral topical administration has several advantages for pa-
tients. First, it is easier to administer drugs by oral topical admin-
istration than any parenteral administration (including digestive 
tract administration, intravenous injection, intramuscular injec-
tion, and subcutaneous injection). Second, drugs administered by 
the oral topical route primarily elicit local effects at the site of 
application, avoiding systemic side effects that might harm the 
liver or kidneys. Since JTE013 acts on multiple mechanisms, in-
cluding promoting bacterial phagocytosis, reducing inflammatory 
cytokine release, and inhibiting osteoclastogenesis, it has the ad-
vantage over administration of any inhibitor which acts on only 
one mechanism (such as only reducing inflammatory cytokine re-
lease) (Rogers et al., 2007) or an antibiotic (Tonetti et al., 2012) 
because antibiotics can cause antibiotic resistance and side ef-
fects associated with using the antibiotics (Bonnetblanc, 2002). 
Interestingly, another study demonstrated that treatment with 
JTE013 in the food in type 2 diabetes obese ob/ob mice increased 
insulin sensitivity and reduced blood glucose compared with

decreased the number of osteoclasts 
induced by ligature placement in the 
periodontal tissues compared DMSO 
treatment in mice. C57BL/6 mice were 
placed with ligatures at the left maxillary 
2nd molar for 15 days. JTE013 (5 mg/
kg) or DMSO was administered oral 
topically at the ligature site once a day for 
15 days. (a) Images of tartrate-resistant 
acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining of 
periodontal tissue sections (magnification 
200x) were displayed. (b) The number of 
TRAP-stained osteoclasts surrounding 
alveolar bone per tissue section was 
calculated (n = 10, *p < .05, ***p < .001).

vehicle treatment (Kitada et al., 2016). Since type 2 diabetic pa-
tients increased prevalence, extent, and severity of periodontal 
disease (Preshaw & Bissett, 2013; Taylor & Borgnakke, 2008), 
JTE013 might be beneficial to treat type 2 diabetes-associated 
periodontitis. Currently, JTE013 has only been used in animal 
studies. In the current study, both groups of mice maintained 
similar body weight after ligature placement. There was no signif-
icant difference in animal body weight between JTE013-treated 
group and vehicle-treated group (data not shown). Future studies 
are needed to determine cytotoxicity, stability, and dissolution 
of JTE013 to be used in future clinical trial, and if JTE013 could 
be administered oral topically at the gingivitis stage in patient 
to prevent disease progression to periodontitis and subsequent 
tooth loss.

It is important to note that this study was limited to the preven-
tion of periodontal disease progression. It is unknown how S1PR2 
and JTE013 may influence bone regeneration after inflammatory 
bone loss. Future studies are needed to determine whether treat-
ment with JTE013 can enhance bone regeneration after periodontal 
bone loss.

In summary, we demonstrate that oral topical administration 
of a S1PR2-specific antagonist, JTE013, attenuated inflammatory 
bone loss in mice with periodontitis induced by ligature placement. 
Treatment with JTE013 inhibited gingival inflammatory cytokines 
release, suppressed periodontal inflammation, reduced osteoclasto-
genesis, and alleviated alveolar bone loss.

Abstract

The aim of this study was to examine whether tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a expression in the phagocytic activity of RAW macro-
phages by trans10–cis12 (10t–12c) conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is associated with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor c
(PPARc) activation. 10t–12c CLA induced the TNF-a expression in RAW macrophages. Phagocytic activity of naive RAW macro-
phages was increased either by recombinant mouse (rm) TNF-a or by culture supernatant from 10t–12c CLA-treated RAW macro-
phages. This phagocytic activity was inhibited by addition of anti-rmTNF-a polyclonal antibody (pAb). 10t–12c CLA also increased
the level of PPARc protein and mRNA in RAW macrophages. When naive RAW macrophages were incubated with the culture super-
natant from RAW macrophages treated with 10t–12c CLA plus GW 9662, a PPARc antagonist, their phagocytic activity was signifi-
cantly inhibited. In addition, GW 9662 antagonized the effect of 10t–12c CLA in stimulating TNF-a expression. These results suggest
that 10t–12c CLA modulates the phagocytic activity of RAW macrophages by upregulating TNF-a expression via a PPARc-dependent
pathway.

1. Introduction

The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs)
are ligand-dependent transcription factors that belong to
the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily and form hetero-
dimers with the retinoid X receptors (RXR) [1,2]. To date,
three isotypes of PPARs, a, b, and c, have been identified
in a number of species. PPARc was initially characterized

as a regulator of adipocyte differentiation and lipid
metabolism and is found in various cell types [3,4].
PPARc is activated by polyunsaturated fatty acids
(PUFAs), the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class of antidiabetic
drugs, a variety of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
and endogenous ligands such as 15-deoxy-D12,14-PGJ2
(15d-PGJ2) [5,6]. 15d-PGJ2 and troglitazone, PPARc
agonists, inhibit phorbol myristyl acetate (PMA)-induced
production of interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-6, and tumor necro-
sis factor (TNF)-a in peripheral blood monocytes [7].
However, pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, also PPARc
agonists, did not inhibit phorbol ester-induced TNF-a

release from human monocytic THP-1 cells [8]. This PPARc
may regulate inflammatory and immune responses by
modulating the activity of monocytes or macrophages.

Dietary fatty acids such as linoleic acid and arachidonic
acid may act as PPARc ligands to modulate lipid metabo-
lism and suppress carcinogenesis, cytokine production,
acute inflammation, and lymphocyte proliferation [9–11].
Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is a class of positional
and geometric isomers of linoleic acid with conjugated
double bonds ranging from 6,8 to 12,14 [12,13]. CLA
has shown a wide range of biologically beneficial effects
such as anti-adipogenic activity, including reduction of
body fat and lowering cholesterol level, and anti-diabeto-
genic, anti-carcinogenic, and anti-atherosclerotic activity
[14–16]. CLA can stimulate or inhibit immune cell func-
tions. CLA increased TNF-a and IL-6 secretion and
decreased IL-4 secretion by splenocytes [17] and reduced
IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-a production by macrophages [18].
CLA modulates expression of genes regulated by PPARc
in muscle and activates PPARc in vitro [19]. In addition,
expression of PPARc is enhanced in CLA-fed pigs [20].
In contrast, CLA down-regulates expression of PPARc,
as well as its target genes, fatty acid binding protein and
liver X receptor a in adipocytes [13]. Murine alveolar mac-
rophages, which express high levels of PPARc, suppress
oxidative burst activity in response to PMA, expression
of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in response to
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and IFN-c, and production of
IL-12 mRNA and protein in response to LPS [21]. These
reports indicate that the effects of CLA in modulating
immune responses are similar to effects induced by ligands
of PPARc.

Two CLA isomers, the cis9–trans11 (9c–11t) CLA and
trans10–cis12 (10t–12c) CLA are known to stimulate the
immune system [22]. The previous studies [23,24] revealed
that 10t–12c CLA has directly no effects on phagocytosis
of peripheral blood phagocytes and on chemotaxis of poly-
morphonuclear cells (PMN). However, 10t–12c CLA was
shown to stimulate peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMC) to secrete soluble factor(s) that increased the che-
motactic and phagocytic activity of PMN, which may be an
important mechanism to enhance the innate immune
response. The phagocytic activity of PMN was demon-
strated to mediate through TNF-a produced by PBMC
stimulated with egg white derivatives, one of immunostim-
ulants [25].

We examined whether TNF-a expression in the phago-
cytic activity of RAW macrophages by 10t–12c CLA is
associated with PPARc activation.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. RAW macrophages

The BALB/c mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7
was purchased from the Korean Cell Line Bank (Seoul,
Korea) and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (Gibco Co., Grand Island, NY, USA) with
4.5 mg/ml L-glutamine supplemented with 10% heat-inacti-
vated fetal calf serum (Gibco Co.) and 100 lg/ml strepto-
mycin in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere.

2.2. Reagents

10t–12c CLA (98% purity; Matreya Inc., Pleasant Gap,
PA, USA) was purchased commercially. 10t–12c CLA
stock solution was prepared by dissolving 10t–12c CLA
in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to final 50 mM and passed
through a 0.45 lm-membrane filter (Milipore Co., Bed-
ford, MA, USA) before use. Recombinant mouse (rm)
TNF-a, goat anti-rmTNF-a polyclonal antibody (pAb),
rabbit anti-goat IgG alkaline phosphatase (AP) conjugate,
GW 9662 (Sigma–Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA), rmP-
PARc, rabbit anti-PPARc pAb, goat anti-rabbit IgG
horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate (Santacruz Bio-
technology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA), and goat anti-
recombinant human (rh) IL-2 pAb (R&D Systems Inc.,
Minneapolis, MN, USA) were also purchased
commercially.

2.3. Culture supernatant

10t–12c CLA and/or GW 9662, a PPARc antagonist,
were added to RAW 264.7 cells culture media with a min-
imal volume (<0.1%) of DMSO as the solvent and the same
amount as vehicle DMSO was added to control cells with-
out 10t–12c CLA treatment. The RAW 264.7 cells at a den-
sity of 5 · 105 cells/ml in 24-well tissue culture plates (Nunc
Co., Naperville, IL, USA) were incubated with 10 lM 10t–
12c CLA, in the presence or absence of 0.01–1 lM GW
9662 at 37 �C in a 5% CO2-humidified atmosphere. After
a 24 h-incubation, all culture supernatants were collected
after centrifugation at 5000g for 30 min, filtered through
a 0.45 lm-pore size membrane filter and stored at �70 �C
until used. The viability of RAW 264.7 cells was consis-
tently more than 90% at the time of culture supernatant
collection, as determined by trypan blue dye exclusion.

2.4. Protein extraction and Western blot

The cultured RAW 264.7 cells were lysed in ice-cold
PRO-PREP� (iNtRon Biotechnology, Seoul, Korea)
protein extraction solution, according to the manufac-
turer’s protocol. Protein concentrations of RAW 264.7
cells lysate and culture supernatant were determined using
the Bradford assay [26]. Electrophoresis of protein lysates
was performed using a 12% polyacrylamide separating
gel (5% stacking gel) in a Tris–glycine buffer system under
denaturing conditions. All samples were mixed with an
equal volume of sample buffer, boiled, and loaded onto
the gel. Proteins were transferred (Trans-Blot� Cell;
Bio-Rad Lab., Hercules, CA, USA) onto 0.2 lm-nitrocel-
lulose membranes (Sartorius AG., Gottingen, Germany)
at 300 mA for 3 h. Non-specific binding sites were blocked



D.-H. Song et al. / Cytokine 37 (2007) 227–235 229
for 3 h with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Tris-buf-
fered saline (TBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST),
and washed briefly three times with TBST. Membranes
were subsequently incubated for 2 h at room temperature
in 0.5% BSA–TBST containing either a rabbit antipeptide
pAb raised against a synthetic PPARc peptide synthesized
using the mouse PPARc sequence, or goat anti-rmTNF-a
pAb. After washing three times with TBST, the membranes
were incubated with either anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with
HRP or anti-goat IgG conjugated with AP in 0.5% BSA/
TBST for 2 h. The membranes were washed twice with
TBST and once with TBS. The membranes with HRP con-
jugated antibody were incubated in chemiluminescent sub-
strate and exposed to Kodak X-AR film (Eastman Kodak,
Rochester, NY, USA). The membranes with AP conju-
gated antibody were incubated with nitro blue tetrazolium
chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (NBT/
BCIP) (Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, Mannheim, Ger-
many) in alkaline phosphatase buffer containing 0.1 M
Tris–HCl (pH 9.5), 0.1 M NaCl, and 5 mM MgCl2. The
reaction was stopped by rinsing membranes with 20 mM
EDTA in TBS.

2.5. Phagocytic activity analyses

One hundred microliter of RAW 264.7 cells, adjusted
to 5 · 106 cells/ml, was added to each well of a 24-well
plate. The RAW 264.7 cells were incubated with
rmTNF-a and culture supernatant from RAW 264.7 cells
(5 · 105 cells/ml) treated with either 10 lM 10t–12c CLA
alone or in combination with 0.01–1 lM GW 9662 for
12 h at 37 �C under a 5% CO2-humidified atmosphere.
For neutralization test, various concentrations of anti-
rmTNF-a pAb were mixed with 10t–12c CLA-stimulated
RAW 264.7 cell culture supernatant. Goat anti-rhIL-2
pAb was used as a control isotype IgG. The samples were
mixed and incubated 30 min at room temperature. Ten
microliter of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-latex
beads (1 · 109 beads/ml, latex bead size, 2.0 lm; Poly-
sciences Inc., Warrington, PA, USA) were added to each
well for the final 2 h. RAW 264.7 cells incubated without
FITC-latex beads were used as a negative control. The
cultured cells were harvested gently by slow pipetting,
centrifuged at 400g for 3 min and washed three times with
PBS containing 3 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid
(EDTA). The supernatant was discarded and replaced
with 1 ml PBS containing 1% paraformaldehyde to stabi-
lize the cells. Phagocytic activity was measured by flow
cytometry (BRYTE HS, Bio-Rad, Microscience Ltd.,
England) and surface-adherent FITC fluorescence on
RAW 264.7 cells was quenched by addition of 20 ll of
a 0.4% trypan blue solution to each tube before flow
cytometry analysis. FITC fluorescence was measured
between 520 and 560 nm on 5000 RAW 264.7 cells per
sample. The cells were gated by forward and side light
scatter characteristics. The results were expressed as per-
centages of absolute phagocytic activities.
2.6. RNA isolation

Total RNA was prepared from RAW 264.7 cells using
the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Co., Carlsbad, CA, USA).
RAW 264.7 cells were mixed with 1 ml TRIzol reagent.
Chloroform (200 ll per 1 ml TRIzol reagent) was added
and the mixture was vigorously vortexed for 15 s. The
lysate was centrifuged for phase separation at 13,000g for
10 min. After separation, the aqueous phase was trans-
ferred to a fresh tube, 500 ll of isopropyl alcohol was
added and the tube gently inverted to mix. The samples
were centrifuged for 10 min. The supernatant was removed
and the visible pellet was washed with 1 ml of 75% ethanol.
The RNA pellet was dissolved in diethylpyrocarbonate
(DEPC)-treated water, and the concentration of RNA
was determined by absorbance at 260 nm.
2.7. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-

PCR) analysis

Total RNA (2 lg) was reverse transcribed into first
strand complementary DNA (cDNA) using the Moloney-
murine leukemia virus (M-MLV) reverse transcriptase
(Ambion Inc., Austin, TX, USA) and a random primer
(9 mer). To determine the conditions under which PCR
amplification of PPARc, TNF-a, and cytochrome c
oxidase subunit I(1A) mRNA are in the logarithmic phase,
1 ll samples were amplified using different numbers of
cycles. The 1A gene was PCR amplified to control for
RNA degradation and variation in mRNA concentrations
in the reverse transcription (RT) reaction. PCR products
and amplification cycles were linearly related in PPARc,
TNF-a, and 1A mRNAs. Thirty cycles of PCR for PPARc
and TNF-a and 25 cycles for 1A were used for quantifica-
tion. The cDNA was amplified in a 20 ll PCR reaction
containing 1 unit Taq polymerase in PCR buffer (Promega
Co., Madison, WI, USA), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dNTP,
and 50 pmol of specific primers. PCR reactions were dena-
tured at 95 �C for 1 min, annealed at 50 �C for 1 min, and
extended at 72 �C for 1.5 min. The cDNA sequences for the
detection of transcripts of PPARc, TNF-a and 1A were
obtained by RT using the following primers (Macrogen
Inc., Seoul, Korea). The PPARc primers were based on
the deposited cDNA sequence (GenBank Accession No.
NM011146): 5 0-GAA AAG ACC CAG CTC TAC AAC-
3 0 (forward) and 5 0-GTT CAG CTG GTC GAT ATC
AC-3 0 (reverse). The TNF-a primers were based on the
deposited cDNA sequence (GenBank Accession No.
NM013693): 5 0-CCT CCC TCT CAT CAG TTC TAT-3 0

(forward) and 5 0-GAG GTT GAC TTT CTC CTC CTG
GT-3 0 (reverse). The 1A gene primers (GenBank Accession
No. J01420) were: 5 0-CAC CGT AGG AGG TCT AAC G-
3 0 (forward) and 5 0-GTA TCG TCG AGG TAT TCC G-3 0

(reverse). PCR products (10 ll) were electrophoresed on a
2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide.
Photographs of the gels were scanned and analyzed using



230 D.-H. Song et al. / Cytokine 37 (2007) 227–235
a digital analysis program (Gel Doc 1000, version 1.5,
Bio-Rad Lab.).

2.8. Data analyses

The one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett’s
test for each pair for multiple comparisons was used in
order to determine statistical significance. Comparisons
of two groups at each GW 9662 concentration were made
by Student‘s t-test. All data expressed as mean ± standard
error of the mean (SEM).

3. Results

3.1. TNF-a expression of RAW macrophages by 10t–12c
CLA

To examine whether 10t–12c CLA induces the produc-
tion of TNF-a in RAW 264.7 cells, Western blot analysis

with 10t–12c CLA (10 lM) for 24 h was performed using
anti-rmTNF-a pAb. A single protein band with a molecu-
lar weight of 16–18 kDa was present in culture supernatant
from RAW 264.7 cells treated with 10t–12c CLA and
rmTNF-a samples, but not medium alone or culture super-
natant from RAW 264.7 cells incubated with vehicle
(DMSO) instead of 10t–12c CLA (Fig. 1A). 10t–12c CLA
(10 lM) stimulation of TNF-a mRNA expression in
RAW 264.7 cells was also examined. As shown in
Fig. 1B, TNF-a mRNA expression of RAW 264.7 cells
was detected by RT-PCR and peaked after 1 h of incuba-
tion with 10t–12c CLA.
3.2. Phagocytic activity of RAW macrophages

RAW 264.7 cells (5 · 105 cells/ml) were incubated for
12 h with culture supernatant (3.13–50%) from RAW
264.7 cells (5 · 105 cells/ml) treated with 10 lM 10t–12c
CLA for 24 h. The phagocytic activity of RAW 264.7 cells

were quantified by a digital analysis program and expressed as a percent of

are 313 and 314 bp, respectively.

isotype IgG were added to the culture supernatant (12.5%) from RAW 264.7 cells (5 · 105 cells/ml) treated with 10 lM 10t–12c CLA for 24 h. RAW 264.7
cell cultures were incubated with these samples for 30 min. All cultures were supplemented with 10 ll of FITC-latex beads (1 · 109 beads/ml) for the final
2 h. The phagocytic activity of RAW 264.7 cells was measured using flow cytometry. The data are presented as mean ± SEM, n = 3, **P < 0.01, compared
to control (in panel A), vehicle-treated RAW 264.7 cell culture supernatant (in panel B) and 10t–12c CLA-treated RAW264.7 cell culture supernatant
(12.5%) (in panel C).

that had been treated with 10t–12c CLA for 24 h was sig-
nificantly enhanced (P < 0.01) in a dose-dependent manner
compared to controls and showed the highest level of stim-
ulation at 12.5% culture supernatant (Fig. 2A). The phag-
ocytic activity of RAW 264.7 cells was also significantly
increased (P < 0.01) in a dose-dependent manner by addi-
tion of 0.01–10 ng/ml rmTNF-a compared to the response
to culture supernatant (12.5%) of RAW 264.7 cells treated
with vehicle (DMSO) instead of 10t–12c CLA for 24 h and
was highest at 1 ng/ml rmTNF-a (Fig. 2B). The effect of
anti-rmTNF-a pAb on the phagocytic activity of RAW
264.7 cells in response to the culture supernatant from
RAW 264.7 cells treated with 10t–12c CLA was examined.
The enhanced phagocytic activity of RAW 264.7 cells to
culture supernatant (12.5%) from RAW 264.7 cells
(5 · 105 cells/ml) treated with 10 lM 10t–12c CLA for
24 h was inhibited (P < 0.01) in a dose-dependent manner
by addition of 0.001–1 lg/ml anti-rmTNF-a pAb, when
compared to the activity induced by the 10t–12c CLA-trea-
ted culture supernatant alone (Fig. 2C). In contrast, the
enhanced phagocytic activity of RAW 264.7 cells in
response to culture supernatant treated with 10t–12c
CLA was not inhibited by addition of anti-rhIL-2 pAb
(1 lg/ml: control IgG) instead of anti-rmTNF-a pAb.

348 and 314 bp, respectively.
3.3. Effect of 10t–12c CLA on PPARc expression of RAW
macrophages

RAW 264.7 cells were incubated with 10t–12c CLA and
harvested for total protein and RNA isolation. Western
blot analysis showed that a 24 h-incubation of RAW
264.7 cells (5 · 105 cells/ml) with 10 lM 10t–12c CLA
induced PPARc protein expression (Fig. 3A). A detectable
PPARc protein was also found in untreated RAW 264.7
when larger amounts of cell lysate (40 lg) were analyzed.
RT-PCR analysis revealed that PPARc mRNA expression
in RAW 264.7 cells was induced by 10t–12c CLA treatment
and peaked at 1 h-incubation, although minor expression
of PPARc was detected in untreated RAW 264.7 cells
(Fig. 3B).

3.4. Effect of a PPARc antagonist, GW 9662, on the
phagocytic activity and TNF-a expression of RAW
macrophages

To examine the effect of a PPARc antagonist, GW
9662 (2-chloro-5-nitrobenzanilide), on the CLA-stimulated
RAW 264.7 cells, culture supernatant (12.5%) from RAW

1 lM GW 9662 for 24 h was prepared. As shown in
Fig. 4A, the phagocytic activity of RAW 264.7 cells
induced by 10t–12c CLA-treated RAW 264.7 cell culture
supernatant was inhibited (P < 0.01) in a dose-dependent
manner by culture supernatant from RAW 264.7 cells
treated with 10t–12c CLA plus GW 9662, compared to
10t–12c CLA-treated culture supernatant alone. In
addition, Western blot and RT-PCR analysis showed
that 0.01–1 lM GW 9662 antagonized the expression of
TNF-a protein (Fig. 4B) and mRNA (Fig. 4C) of RAW
264.7 cells induced by 10t–12c CLA, in a dose-dependent
manner.

4. Discussion

Expression of TNF-a is elevated in undifferentiated
human monocytes or incompletely differentiated macro-
phage RAW 264.7 cells in comparison to differentiated
human macrophages [27]. High concentrations of the
PPARc ligands troglitazone (30 lM) and 15d-PGJ2
(10 lM) inhibited the expression of TNF-a as well as
decreased the cell viability in vitro [28]. In contrast,
10 lM 10t–12c CLA, used in this study, up-regulated
TNF-a expression and maintained a high RAW 264.7 cell
viability of greater than 90%. The phagocytic activity of
RAW 264.7 cells was enhanced by either culture superna-
tant from RAW 264.7 cells treated with 10t–12c CLA or
rmTNF-a. In addition, anti-rmTNF-a pAb neutralized
the enhanced phagocytic activity of RAW 264.7 cells stim-
ulated by culture supernatant from 10t–12c CLA treated
RAW 264.7 cells. These findings indicate that 10t–12c
CLA stimulates RAW 264.7 cells to produce TNF-a, which
enhances the phagocytic activity of RAW 264.7 cells.

TNF-a is a natural stimulant which promotes the phag-
ocytic activity of phagocytes [29]. It has beeen reported that
the enhanced phagocytic activity of PMN by culture super-
natant from PBMC treated with immunostimulating egg
white derivatives, was due to TNF-a, but not IL-1 [25].
Rats fed a diet containing 10t–12c CLA have the enhanced
phagocytic activity of phagocytes, correlated with an
increase in plasma TNF-a [30]. The CLA stimulated tumor
cell killing ability of macrophages has been associated with
induction of TNF-a expression [31]. It has been also
reported that CLA decreases the synthesis of prostaglandin
E2 (PGE2) [32], and PGE2 has been shown to have
profound down-regulatory effects on various inflammatory
cells [33]. PGE2 has been reported to regulate macrophage
TNF-a production through negative feedback [34]. There-
fore, one possible explanation for increased TNF-a
expression in porcine PBMC treated with t10c12-CLA
may be related to decreased PGE2 regulation of TNF-a.

The results demonstrated that 10t-12c CLA increased
the level of PPARc protein and mRNA in RAW 264.7
cells. This finding is consistent with reports that the expres-
sion of PPARc was increased in CLA-fed pigs [20] and
that the supplementation of CLA in the diet enhanced
the colonic expression of PPARc [35]. Since CLA under-
goes elongation and desaturation processes similar to those
of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as linoleic
acid, D6 desaturase metabolites of CLA can also activate
PPARc expression [12]. Thus, the induction of PPARc
expression may occur through direct binding of CLA as
well as active metabolites of CLA [36]. These results
suggest that CLA acts as a ligand of PPARc and activates
PPARc.

The present study indicates that 10t–12c CLA stimulates
both PPARc and TNF-a expression in RAW 264.7 cells.
We used a specific and high affinity PPARc antagonist
(nanomolar IC50, [37]), GW 9662, to elucidate the role of
PPARc on TNF-a expression in RAW 264.7 cells induced
by 10t–12c CLA. GW 9662 antagonized the effect of
10t–12c CLA on TNF-a expression of RAW 264.7 cells
as well as their phagocytic activity induced by TNF-a.
These results suggest that the effects of 10t–12c-CLA on
TNF-a production in RAW 264.7 cells may be dependent
on the PPARc pathway. High affinity PPARc ligands such
as the thiazolidinedione (TZD) antidiabetic agent AD-5075
and the non-TZD insulin-sensitizing agent L-796,499 did
not inhibit production of TNF-a and IL-6 in RAW 264.7
cells [38].

In conclusion, the overall results of this study show that
the effect of 10t–12c CLA on the phagocytic activity of
RAW 264.7 macrophages might be mediated by TNF-a
expression via a PPARc-dependent pathway.

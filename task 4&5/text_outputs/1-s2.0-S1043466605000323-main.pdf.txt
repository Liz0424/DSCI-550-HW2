Abstract

cDNA encoding goose IL-2 (GoIL-2) was cloned from Con A-stimulated goose splenic mononuclear cells (SMC)
using oligonucleotide primers based on the conserved sequence of duck (DuIL-2), chicken (ChIL-2) and turkey IL-2s (TuIL-2).

The GoIL-2 cDNA is 718 nt long, which contains an open reading frame (ORF) of 423 base pairs encoding a protein of 141 aa. The
GoIL-2 shows, respectively, 79%, 82e85%, and 91e92% identities with TuIL-2, ChIL-2 and DuIL-2 in cDNA, and also
shows, respectively, 63%, 63e64%, and 82e85% identities with TuIL-2, ChIL-2 and DuIL-2 in amino acid sequence. Recombinant
GoIL-2 (rGoIL-2) protein expressed in Escherichia coli has an approximate molecular weight of 18 kDa. The rGoIL-2 has biological
effect on goose and duck as well as chicken lymphocytes in a dose-dependent manner, though the effect on duck and chicken
lymphocytes has been found to be relatively weak. In addition, rGoIL-2 also strengthens goose immune responses induced by

vaccinating the inactivated oil emulsion vaccine against avian influenza virus. The monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to rGoIL-2
recognized the binding epitopes of nature GoIL-2 protein expressed in vero cells. Antiserum and mAb 5B10 to rGoIL-2 can inhibit
the biological activity of rGoIL-2 and endogenous GoIL-2. The results, at the first time, indicated that goose IL-2 reserves species-
specialties in the biological functions and can be used as a potential immunoadjuvant for goose vaccination and immunotherapeutic

purposes. Finally, the mAbs to rGoIL-2 also provide a useful tool for further immunobiological studies of IL-2 in avian immune
systems.

1. Introduction

IL-2 is a glycoprotein produced principally by
activated T cells and some B cells and a cytokine that
regulates lymphocyte function. IL-2 controls the ampli-
fication of native T cells by initially stimulating growth
following antigen activation, and also has effects on NK
cells, monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils [1e4].
IL-2 has been developed as an immunotherapeutic agent
in chronic microbial infection and cancer, and as an
enhancing agent in vaccine [5e7]. Previous reports also

found that IL-2 exerts its effects by binding to the high
affinity IL-2 receptors (IL-2R) present on those cells
[8]. IL-2R is composed of three distinct subunits:
IL-2Ra, IL-2Rb and IL-2Rg which are encoded, re-
spectively, by distinct and structurally unrelated genes
[9]. Resting T cells express low levels of IL-2Ra-subunit
(Tac antigen) that binds to IL-2 with a low affinity.
IL-2Rb-subunit alone or in combination with a or g
produce a receptor with intermediate affinity, and the
g-subunit alone does not bind IL-2, while a receptor
comprised of three subunits offers the highest affinity for
IL-2 [8].

Up to now, in addition to human IL-2, IL-2 genes for
more than 30 animal species also have been cloned and
identified [10]. Recently, IL-2 gene for chicken (ChIL-2)
and turkey (TuIL-2) have been cloned and sequenced

successfully [11e13]. The ChIL-2 gene is mapped to
chromosome 4, linked to annexin V with synteny with
mouse chromosome 3 and human chromosome 4 [12].
Our previous study revealed that some variations exist in
the open reading frame (ORF) of ChIL-2 from different
chicken breeds [14]. The cDNAcoding forChIL-2 protein
was introduced into several prokaryotic and eukaryotic
expression systems to produce biologically active re-
combinant cytokines [13,15,16]. ChIL-2 plays an impor-
tant role as an immunoregulatory molecule identical to
mammalian IL-2 and has been shown to stimulate T
lymphoblast cells, increase the proportion of both CD4

C

andCD8
C
peripheral bloodT cells [17], enhanceNK cells

activity and vaccine response to Eimeria parasites [18],
and strengthen the protective immunity against infectious
bursal disease virus [19], indicating that ChIL-2 has
practical importance in potentially enhancing immune
responses to vaccines and infectious agents in poultry.
Furthermore, mAbs to ChIL-2 have also been produced,
and used to study the biological activities of ChIL-2
[20,21]. Comparatively, little work has been performed on
avian IL-2s and their receptors. Only a mAb designated
INN-CH-16 can react with a 48e50 kDa antigen ex-
pressed on activated chicken T lymphocytes and inhibited
the proliferation of Con A-stimulated blasts in response
to supernatants of stimulated chicken T cells. These
features led to the hypothesis that INN-CH-16 may
recognize the ChIL-2R [22,23].

As for waterfowl cytokines in 1997, Bertram et al.
[24] found lymphokines released by duck peripheral
blood lymphocytes and splenocytes stimulated with
PHA, which was of similar functional homology to
ChIL-2 in maintaining the lymphocyte proliferation.
Recently, the cloning and functional characterization of
duck IL-2 have been reported [25e27]. However, no
information was available on the goose cytokines.
Hereby, the goal of the present study was to molecularly
clone the cDNA fragment of goose IL-2 (GoIL-2), to
express the GoIL-2 open reading frame in vitro
expression system, to prepare mAbs to GoIL-2, and to
detect the bioactivity of the recombinant GoIL-2
(rGoIL-2) protein in vitro and in vivo.

2. Results

2.1. Molecular cloning and analysis of goose
IL-2 cDNA

The mRNA was isolated from goose SMC stimulated
with 10 mg/ml Con A at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 14, 16, 18, 24, 48
and 72 h. GoIL-2 cDNA fragment was amplified by RT-
PCR using these mRNAs as templates. An approxi-
mately 0.8 kb DNA fragment, in size, was amplified
from nine of the 12 mRNAs (Fig. 1). The sequencing
results revealed that cDNA fragment of GoIL-2 was
718 nt in length (GenBank accession no. AY392557).
GoIL-2 cDNA fragment encodes a polypeptide of 141
amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of
16.29 kDa. Analysis of the signal peptide revealed that
there was a potential cleavage site between amino acid
residues 21 and 22 (arrow in Fig. 2). The predicted signal
peptide of GoIL-2 was similar in size to that of
mammalian animals (20 aa) and other birds (22 aa).

The deduced amino acid sequence of GoIL-2 was
compared with those of the several avian andmammalian
species. The alignment analysis showed that GoIL-2
shared 85% identity to DuIL-2 (GenBank accession
no. AY193713), 63% to ChIL-2 (GenBank accession no.
AF294321), 64% to TuIL-2 (GenBank accession
no. AJ007463), 9% to human IL-2 (GenBank accession
no. U25676), and 7e20% to other mammalian IL-2s. As
shown in Fig. 2, in IL-2 sequences of the compared avian
species, there are 78 conserved amino acid residues
including three cysteine residues (position 63, 70 and
119), indicating that there is at least one di-sulfate bond in
the molecules. However, Lys

four amino acid residues (Ala

)

were conserved in chicken and turkey IL-2s, but were
variable in goose and duck IL-2s. Phylogenetic analysis
(Fig. 3) shows further that the avian IL-2s were
subdivided into two monophyletic lineages. The goose
and duck IL-2s formed a monophyletic group distinct
from ChIL-2 and TuIL-2, confirming the similarity
between duck and goose IL-2s.

2.2. Expression and purification of the
His-GoIL-2 fusion protein

The gene fragment encoding GoIL-2 protein (without
signal peptide) was cloned into the pBAD/His B
expression vector, where the araB promoter is controlled
by arabinose. After induction with 0.2% L-(C)-arabinose
and resolved in a SDS-PAGE, the expressed recombinant
GoIL-2 with an approximatemolecular weight of 18 kDa

purified from the sonicated bacterial cells under native
(Fig. 4, lane 4) and denaturing (Fig. 4, lane 5) conditions
also can be observed.

2.3. Production and identification of
mAbs specific for GoIL-2

Following immunization with rGoIL-2 protein puri-
fied under denaturing conditions as an immunogen, five
murine hybridoma clones were identified to produce
mAbs (3B2, 5B10, 3C4, 5D4 and 2F7). Data in Table 1
showed that all these mAbs recognized rGoIL-2 by
ELISA and Western blot assays. The mAbs did not
react with 6!Histamine, rChIL-2 or with rDuIL-2.
Isotype of the five mAbs was found to be all IgG1 and k
chain. Rabbit antiserum against rGoIL-2 produced as
described in Section 4.4 could also specifically react with
rGoIL-2, but do not react with any protein in the cell
lysate of Escherichia coli LMG194 strain transformed
with empty pBAD/His B (data not shown).

2.4. Eukaryotic expression of GoIL-2

In order to express the GoIL-2 protein in the
eukaryotic cells, pEGFP-GoIL-2 plasmid was trans-
fected into vero cells. As shown in Fig. 5b, the EGFP-
GoIL-2 expressed in vero cells as early as 3 h after
transfection. In immunocytochemical staining, the
acetone-fixed pEGFP-GoIL-2-transfected vero cells
were detected, respectively, by five mAbs to rGoIL-2
(Fig. 5deh), while no signal was observed in vero cells
transfected with pEGFP-c2 vector (Fig. 5c), demon-
strating that these mAbs hold the epitopes of GoIL-2
protein expressed in vero cells.

2.5. In vitro bioactivity of goose IL-2

The concentration of the E. coli-derived soluble
rGoIL-2 in the protein preparation was 0.656 mg/ml.
The biological activity of E. coli-derived rGoIL-2 and
endogenous GoIL-2 was tested by in vitro proliferation
of goose, duck and chicken spleen cells. Goose
(5! 106 cells/well), duck (5! 106 cells/well) and chicken
(5! 106 cells/well) spleen cells were cultured in the
presence of either rGoIL-2, irrelevant protein control,
RPMI-1640eFCS or the supernatants from Con A-
stimulated SMC in a series of 2-fold dilutions. Data in
Fig. 6A showed that 1.6 ng rGoIL-2/well can significantly
stimulate in vitro proliferation of goose lymphocytes,
while rGoIL-2 was 6.3 ng/well for duck lymphocytes
and 25 ng/well for chicken lymphocytes. These results
indicated that the stimulation effect of rGoIL-2 on both
chicken and duck lymphocytes was weak. On the other
hand, 0.8 ng/well rChIL-2 was needed in the proliferation
assay of chicken lymphocytes and 12.5 ng rChIL-2/well
for duck lymphocytes and 6.3 ng rChIL-2/well for goose
lymphocytes (Fig. 6B). 6.3 ng/well rDuIL-2 induces
significantly in vitro proliferation of duck lymphocytes

while 12.5 ng rDuIL-2/well is needed for goose lympho-
cytes and 12.5 ng rDuIL-2/well for chicken lymphocytes
(Fig. 6C). Neither the protein control from E. coli
LMG194 strain transfected with pBAD/His B vector
alone, nor the RPMI-1640eFCS could stimulate the
proliferation of activated goose, duck and chicken
lymphocytes.

2.6. Ability of mAbs to neutralize the biological
activity of recombinant and endogenous IL-2

Five mAbs and one pAb to rGoIL-2 were tested for
their ability to neutralize the biological function of the
recombinant and endogenous GoIL-2 as measured by
the inhibition of Con A-stimulated lymphocyte pro-
liferation. Only mAb 5B10 and pAb exhibited neutral-
izing activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7). mAb
5B10 neutralized 85% of the lymphocyte-stimulating
activity of rGoIL-2 and 80% for endogenous GoIL-2.
The inhibiting effect of pAb on the activity of rGoIL-2
and endogenous GoIL-2 was found to be 100%.

2.7. In vivo immune response to AIV vaccine induced
by rGoIL-2

Following the intramuscular inoculations with the
rGoIL-2 and the inactivated oil emulsion AIV vaccine,
blood samples were collected at specified times and the
serum HI antibody to AIV was measured. As shown in
Table 2, in gooses injected intramuscularly with both
rGoIL-2 protein (300 ng or 350 ng per goose, respec-
tively) and AIV vaccine 2 weeks after immunization, the
average titers of HI antibodies to AIV reached 6.3e6.4
log 2, while the average titers of HI antibody to AIV
were 5.2e5.3 log 2 in gooses only vaccinated with AIV
vaccine or with both 250 ng rGoIL-2 and AIV vaccine.
The results clearly showed that 300 ng rGoIL-2 per
goose strengthened in vivo immune responses induced
by the inactivated oil emulsion AIV vaccine.

3. Discussion

Up to date, information about goose IL-2 has not
been available. Recently, the cloning and functional
characterization of chicken, turkey and duck IL-2s have
been reported [11e15,17,25e27]. The amino acid identity
amongst these avian IL-2s was up to 58e73%. In this
report, the goose IL-2 cDNA was cloned by RT-PCR
using primers based on the highly conserved regions
among chicken, turkey and duck IL-2s. We found that
GoIL-2mRNAwas undetectable usingRT-PCR in goose
SMC 1 h and 72 h after Con A stimulation, but was
detected in all samples from 2 h to 48 h after stimulation,
showing that GoIL-2 expression began 1 h after stimula-
tion and stopped 72 h after stimulation. Sundick et al. [11]
detected the ChIL-2 mRNA 5 h after stimulation with
ConA. Inmitogen-stimulatedmouse spleen cells, the IL-2
gene is only transiently expressed with maximal mRNA
steady state levels between 6e14 h post-stimulation [28].
IL-2 mRNA expression of northern elephant seal peaked
in the first 8 h following Con A stimulation [29].

Whether rGoIL-2 protein expressed in E. coli pos-
sessed a biological function, we measured the bioactivity
of GoIL-2 protein using in vitro lymphocyte proliferation
and in vivo immune responses of AIV vaccine vaccina-
tion. As little as 1.6 ng/well of rGoIL-2 could significantly
stimulate in vitro proliferation of goose lymphocytes
while 6.3 ng rGoIL-2/well was needed for duck lympho-
cytes and 25 ng rGoIL-2/well for chicken lymphocytes
were need (Fig. 6A). In addition, after each goose was
intramuscularly vaccinated with a dose of 300e350 ng
rGoIL-2, the vaccinated gooses reveal strengthening
immune responses to AIV vaccine immunization. These
data suggested that rGoIL-2 had biological effects,
though the effect on duck and chicken lymphocytes was
relatively weak. These evidences mentioned above led
to sufficient support that functional similarity existed
between goose and duck as well as chicken IL-2
molecules. Furthermore, these results implied that the
rGoIL-2 was an important immunoregulatory molecule
well-studied in chicken and mammalian counterparts
[30e33]. Similarly, an in vitro proliferation of chicken,
duck and goose lymphocytes induced byChIL-2 aswell as
DuIL-2 was similar to that of GoIL-2 (Fig. 6B and C).
The result further demonstrated that the effect of
rGoIL-2, rChIL-2 and rDuIL-2 was dose dependent
and certain species-specialties existed. Previous reports
showed that there was certain species-characteristic

between IL-2 from cells of various species [34e38]. The
proliferative response of human lymphocytes to recombi-
nant porcine IL-2 was only 50% of that seen with
recombinant HuIL-2 [38]. Recombinant ovine IL-2 was
able to stimulate the proliferation of bovine lymphocytes
but not porcine lymphocytes. It was not surprising that
there was 97% amino acid identity between the ovine and
bovine proteins while the amino acid identity between
ovine and porcine IL-2 was 73%. Both ovine and bovine
IL-2 amino acid residues involved in the binding to the
human equivalents of the IL-2Ra (p55) and IL-2Rb (p75)
subunits showed further that both these two domains of
the ligand were entirely conserved [34,38]. Comparison of
the ovine and porcine IL-2 amino acid sequences revealed
that six of the 25 residues involved in binding to the IL-
2Ra (p55) were different. As for the IL-2Rb (p75) binding
domain, five of the 10 amino acid residues were different.
Hence, the amino acid residues in the two receptor
binding domains were less conserved between ovine and
porcine IL-2 compared with the ovine and bovine IL-2
[39].

In our study, five mAbs specific for rGoIL-2
were produced. Anti-GoIL-2 mAbs do not recognize
rDuIL-2 and rChIL-2 proteins. While the E. coli-derived
rGoIL-2 could be recognized by mAbs 5H6 and 5F6
to rDuIL-2, indicating that five anti-GoIL-2 mAbs
recognized a conserved epitope in the duck and chicken
molecules. And mAbs 5H6 and 5F6 to rDuIL-2
recognized conserved epitopes in duck and goose
molecules. Furthermore, all mAb to E. coli-derived
GoIL-2 reacted specifically with EGFP-GoIL-2 protein
expressed in vero cells, evincing that the five mAbs
remained the binding epitopes of nature GoIL-2.
However, in neutralizing assay, only one of the five mAbs
(mAb 5B10) was able to neutralize the activity of rGoIL-2
and endogenous GoIL-2 in Con A-induced lymphocyte
proliferation assay, indicating that only mAb 5B10 reacts
with the functional domain of GoIL-2 protein.

4. Materials and methods

4.1. Animals

The embryonated eggs of Eastern Zhejiang White
goose (Xiangshan institute of Eastern Zhejiang White
goose, China) and Muscovy duck (Yuyao Shennong
poultry Co. Ltd., Zhejiang, China) were hatched at our
laboratory, and reared in a special room with unlimited
access to feed and water and used at 30 days. Thirty day-
old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) Leghorn chickens were
obtained from Beijing Merial Vital Laboratory Animal
Technology Co. Ltd., Beijing, China. Four week-old
BALB/c mice were purchased from Shanghai Labora-
tory Animal Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences,
Shanghai, China. New Zealand white rabbits (NZW

rabbit) were purchased from Laboratory Animal Center
of Zhejiang Academy of Medicine, Zhejiang, China. All
laboratory animals and animal subjects used in this
study have been approved by the scientific ethical
committee of the Zhejiang University.

4.2. RNA isolation, RT-PCR and sequencing

Goose splenicmononuclear cells (SMC)were prepared
as previously described by Zhou et al. [14]. SMC
stimulated with Con A for 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 14, 16, 18, 24,
48 and 72 h were harvested, respectively. Total cellular
mRNA was extracted with Trizol reagent (Gibco BRL,
Gaithersburg, MD). Primers were designed according to
the conserved cDNA sequence for DuIL-2, ChIL-2 and
TuIL-2 (GenBank accession no. AF294323, AF017645
and AJ007463, respectively). Sense primer (5#-AATAC-
TAGCACAGACAACCAG-3#) corresponded nt posi-
tions 59e81. Antisense primer (5#-TTACTGAAAGAT-
TTATTAAATATCATCTA-3#) was complementary to
nt positions 798e824. The cDNAs were synthesized from
total cellular RNA using the antisense primer. PCR was
conducted with sense and antisense primers under the
conditions consisting of 30 cycles of denaturation at
95 �C for 1 min, primer annealing at 45 �C for 45 s and
DNA extension at 72 �C for 2 min. The final DNA
extension was carried out at 72 �C for 10 min. RT-PCR
products were detected in 1% agarose gel. RT-PCR
product was sequenced. The predicted amino acid
sequence of GoIL-2 protein was compared with that of
avian and mammalian IL-2s from GenBank using
DNASTAR 5.0 software (DNASTAR Inc., Madison,
WI, USA). Putative Signal peptide of GoIL-2 protein
was determined using prediction servers at http://
www.cbs.dtu.dk./services/.

4.3. Expression and purification of recombinant
GoIL-2

Based on the cDNA sequence of the above-men-
tioned GoIL-2, the GoIL-2 ORF without the putative
signal peptide sequence was obtained by PCR using the
upstream primer 5#-GCGAATTCGCACCTCTATCA-

GAGAA-3# containing the EcoRI site and the down-
stream primer 5#-GCAAGCTTTTATTTTAGCATA-
GATCT-3# containing the HindIII site. Following
digestion with EcoRI and HindIII, the PCR product
was subcloned into the vector pBAD/His B (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) for expression as a His-tagged protein,
named as pBAD-GoIL-2. The pBAD-GoIL-2 plasmid
was transformed into competent E. coli LMG194 cells
(Invitrogen) and the transformants were screened on LB
plates for ampicillin resistance. Plasmid DNA from
resistant colonies was identified and sequenced to
determine the size and orientation of the insert. His-
GoIL-2 expression was induced by the manufacturer’s
protocols, and checked by SDS-PAGE as described
previously by Zhou et al. [40]. For the purification of
the soluble recombinant His-GoIL-2 (rGoIL-2), the
bacterial pellet was suspended in buffer B (100 mM
NaH2PO4, 10 mM TriseCl, 8 M urea, pH 8.0) and lysed
thoroughly by sonication on ice. The lysate was
centrifuged at 10,000! g for 20 min at room tempera-
ture (RT). Then the supernatant was collected and
applied to a nickel column (Qiagen) to purify histidine-
tagged proteins according to the manufacturer’s in-
structions. The concentration of the purified rGoIL-2
was determined spectroscopically at 595 nm using a
protein assay kit based on the Bradford reagent (Biorad,
Hercules, CA). Western blot analysis of the expressed
rGoIL-2 protein was checked as previously described by
Zhou et al. [40] with anti-X-press� mAb (Invitrogen),
anti-human IL-2 mAb (Bender Medsystem Gmbh,
Austria), and anti-DuIL-2 mAbs [26], anti-mouse
IL-2 mAb (R&D systems Inc., U.S.A), anti-ChIL-2
mAbs [41].

To prepare native soluble His-GoIL-2 for prolifera-
tion assay, the bacterial pellet was washed with PBS (pH
7.2) for three times and resuspended in lysis buffer
(50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM
imidazole) at 2e5 ml per gram wet weight with 0.01%
Triton-X 100, frozen in liquid nitrogen, thawed entirely
under 37 �C water bath and sonicated on ice for three
30 s pulses with intervening 20 s pauses. The lysed cells
were centrifuged at 10,000! g for 20 min at 4 �C. The
rGoIL-2 was purified under native conditions from the
resulting supernatant by the above-mentioned nickel
column. The purified rGoIL-2 was dialyzed against PBS,
concentrated using the PEG 6000. Polymixin B Sephar-
ose (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was used to remove LPS
from the purified proteins. The bacterial protein from
E. coli LMG194 strain transformed with empty pBAD/
His B vector were prepared and used as protein control.

4.4. Production and characterization of monoclonal
and polyclonal antibodies to GoIL-2

MAbs specific for rGoIL-2 were obtained by immu-
nizingmice with purified rGoIL-2 as described previously

336 J.-Y. Zhou et al. / Cytokine 30 (2005) 328e338
[26,40]. Briefly, the spleen cells isolated from immunized
mice were fused with the sp2/0 myeloma cells by standard
methods. Hybridoma supernatants were screened for
specific binding to rGoIL-2 by the indirect ELISA as
described earlier [19], using 6!His, cell lysate of E. coli
LMG194, rDuIL-2 [26], rChIL-2 [41] and rGoIL-2 as
antigens. Hybridomas secreting mAbs to GoIL-2 were
isolated and cloned by limiting dilution for acites
production. The isotypes of the mAbs were determined
using a commercial kit (Southern Biotechnology Asso-
ciates, Inc., Birmingham, AL 35260, USA). Western blot
analysis of mAbs to rGoIL-2 was screened as the above-
mentioned method.

Anti-rGoIL-2 rabbit polyclonal antibody (pAb) was
generated by bi-weekly immunization of NZW rabbits
with rGoIL-2-CFA emulsion (100 mg of rGoIL-2 per
rabbit). Immunized rabbits were bled 14 days after last
injection and the serum was collected.

4.5. Preparation of endogenous GoIL-2 protein

The suspensions of the goose SMC were prepared as
the method mentioned above. Goose SMC were diluted
to 1! 107 cells/ml in RPMI-1640 containing 10% FCS
and 10 mg/ml Con A, and incubated at 40 �C in 5% CO2
for 0, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48,72 and 96 h. At each time point,
the residual Con A was moved by incubating with 0.1 M
a-methyl-D-mannoside (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis,
USA) for 30 min and the supernatant was harvested by
centrifugation at 10,000! g for 10 min at 4 �C.

4.6. Antigen (Ag)-capture ELISA for GoIL-2

For quantification of rGoIL-2 expressed in E. coli
and endogenous GoIL-2 in supernatants from Con A-
stimulated SMC, an Ag-capture ELISA was developed
with certain modifications as described previously [20].
Briefly mAbs and pAb to GoIL-2 were purified by fast
protein liquid chromatography (AmershamePharmacia
Biotech, Piscataway, NJ), and rGoIL-2 purified under
denaturing conditions was used as a reference protein.
Ninety-six-well flat-bottom plates (NUNC, Denmark)
were coated with mAb (10 mg/ml, 100 ml/well) to GoIL-2
in 0.1 M carbonate buffer, pH 9.6 at 37 �C for 1 h
followed at 4 �C overnight. Each well was blocked with
200 ml PBS containing 3% BSA for 1 h at RT followed
by three washes with 0.05 M PBST (PBS containing
0.01% Tween 20). One hundred microlitres of culture
supernatant from Con A-stimulated SMC or protein
preparations containing rGoIL-2 was added to each well
and incubated for 4 h at RT. pAb to rGoIL-2 (100 ml/
well) in PBSe0.1% BSA was added and incubated for
1 h at RT after five washes. After incubation with HRP-
labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Kirkegaard & Perry
Laboratories, Inc., Maryland, USA) for 30 min at RT.
Peroxidase activity was detected by adding 100 ml/well
of o-phenylenediamine (0.4 mg/ml in 0.05 M PBS, pH
5.0) substrate (Sigma) incubated for 15 min, and re-
action was stopped by the addition of 50 ml of 2 M
sulfate acid. Reactions were monitored by an automated
microtiter plate reader at 490 nm.

4.7. Construction of eukaryotic expression vector,
transfection and immunocytochemical staining

The GoIL-2 ORF with the signal peptide sequence
was amplified by PCR using the upstream primer
5#-GCGAATTCATGATGTGCAAAGTACTGATC3-#
containing the EcoRI site and downstream primer
5#-TTGGATCCTTTTTGCAGATATCTCAC-3# con-
taining the BamHI site. The PCR product was subcloned
into the pEGFP-c2 plasmid (BD Biosciences Clontech,
Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. The resulting plasmid pEGFP-GoIL-2 was trans-
fected into the vero cells which had been seeded into
24-well plates (1! 105 cells/well) using a commercially
available lipofectamine 2000 (2.5 mg/ml, Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) in Opti-MEM medium (Gibco). The cells
were examinedunder an inverted fluorescencemicroscope
3 h post-transfection. Then the cells were fixed with 80%
cold acetone at �20 �C. After washing three times with
PBS, the cells were blocked for 1 h at 37 �Cwith 5% skim
milk and 0.1%Triton-X 100 in PBST. The cells were then
incubated with the mAbs to rGoIL-2 diluted in PBST
containing 2% skim milk for 1 h at 37 �C. Washed three
times with PBST, the cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 �C
with HRP-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Kirkegaard &
Perry Laboratories). Color development was carried out
with 9-aminoethyl carbazole (Sigma) and hydrogen
peroxide in 0.05 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0). The
cell expressed GoIL-2 was stained reddish-brown in this
assay.

4.8. Bioassay and neutralization

Lymphocyte proliferation induced by rGoIL-2 was
detected by MTT test [42]. Briefly, SMC from the
chickens, ducks and gooses were, respectively, sus-
pended at 1! 107 cells/ml in RPMI-1640eFCS con-
taining 10 mg/ml Con A, and incubated at 40 �C in 5%
CO2 for 24 h. SMC stimulated by Con A for 24 h were
incubated in RPMI-1640 medium containing 0.1 M
a-methyl-D-mannoside (Sigma) at 40 �C for 30 min.
The cells were applied to Histopaque-1077 (Sigma) and
live cells were selected after centrifugation. The enriched
viable cell population was resuspended in RPMI-1640
containing 10% FCS and cultured at 5! 106 cells/ml
with the supernatant containing endogenous GoIL-2 as
well as rGoIL-2 proteins in triplicates in 96-well micro-
titer plates (100 ml/well, Costar, Corning, NY, USA).
The cells containing RPMI-1640eFCS and protein
control from E. coli LMG194 strain transformed with



337J.-Y. Zhou et al. / Cytokine 30 (2005) 328e338
pBAD/His B vector alone were used as negative controls.
After incubation at 40 �C for 48 h, 20 ml MTT (5 mg/ml)
was added to each well and reacted for 4 h. One hundred
microlitres of lysis buffer (10% SDSe0.01 mol/l HCl)
was added to each well. Plates were incubated for 20 h at
40 �C under 5% CO2 and OD value was measured at
570 nm. ODGoIL-2/ODnegative value of 1.5 or above was
defined as the positive criteria for the biological activity
of rGoIL-2.

Neutralizing capacity of mAbs and pAb to rGoIL-2
was screened in 96-well plates as describedpreviouslywith
modifications [43]. Briefly, by fixing rGoIL-2 with anti-
bodies in different concentrations, His-GoIL-2 (1.6 ng/
well) and supernatant of Con A-stimulated goose SMC
(100 ml/well) was mixed, respectively, with an equal
volume of serial 10-fold dilutions of mAbs or pAb and
incubated for 1 h at 37 �C. One hundred microlitres of
cells (5! 106 cells/ml) stimulated by ConA for 24 h were
added to each well. Non-immunized rabbit serum and
mAb to spike protein of IBV [40] were used as negative
controls. Cultures were incubated for 48 h at 40 �C and
cell proliferation was measured as above. The percent
neutralizing ability of monoclonal and polyclonal anti-
bodies against rGoIL-2 was calculated with the formula
as described by Zhou et al. [27].

4.9. Goose immunization and antibody detection

Forty-five day-old Eastern Zhejiang white gooses were
divided into five groups, with 10 gooses per group. After
Group 1, Group 2 and Group 3 gooses were each
intramuscularly and, respectively, injected with a dose
of 250 ng, 300 ng and 350 ng rGoIL-2, all gooses were
immunized intramuscularly with the commercial inacti-
vated oil emulsion vaccine against avian influenza virus
according to the manufacture’s instruction at once [AIV
(H9N2), Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese
Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, China].
Gooses in Group 4 only were each intramuscularly
vaccinated with the inactivated AIV oil emulsion vaccine
(H9N2), while gooses in the 5th Group were each
intramuscularly immunized with the oil adjuvant as
a control. Under the same feeding condition, blood
samples were collected via wing vein puncture at 1, 2, 3
and 4 weeks after immunization. The hemagglutinin-
inhibition (HI) antibody titer against AIV was measured
by the HI assay according to the manufacture’s in-
struction (Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese
Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, China).

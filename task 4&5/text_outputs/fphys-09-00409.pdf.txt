Besides its primary function in locomotion, skeletal muscle (SKM), which represents up to

half of human’s weight, also plays a fundamental homeostatic role. Through the secretion

of soluble peptides, or myokines, SKM interacts with major organs involved in metabolic

processes. In turn, metabolic cues from these organs are received by muscle cells,

which adapt their response accordingly. This is done through an intricate intracellular

signaling network characterized by the cross-talking between anabolic and catabolic

pathways. A fine regulation of the network is required to protect the organism from

an excessive energy expenditure. Systemic inflammation evokes a catabolic reaction

in SKM known as sarcopenia. In turn this response comprises several mechanisms,

which vary depending on the nature of the insult and its magnitude. In this regard,

aging, chronic inflammatory systemic diseases, osteoarthritis and idiopathic inflammatory

myopathies can lead to muscle loss. Interestingly, sarcopenia may persist despite

remission of chronic inflammation, an issue which warrants further research. The Janus

kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) system stands as

a major participant in muscle loss during systemic inflammation, while it is also a

well-recognized orchestrator of muscle cell turnover. Herein we summarize current

knowledge about models of sarcopenia, their triggers and major mediators and their

effect on both protein and cell growth yields. Also, the dual action of the JAK/STAT

pathway in muscle mass changes is discussed. We highlight the need to unravel the

precise contribution of this system to sarcopenia in order to design targeted therapeutic

strategies.

Skeletal muscle (SKM) is a vast organ, which accounts for 40% of total weight in non-obese
population (Janssen et al., 2000). The high metabolic activity of muscle cells, or myocytes, not only
provides the necessary contraction for locomotion, but also fuels other organs’ functions. Through
the secretion of soluble peptides called myokines, the SKM interacts with surrounding fat, bones
and skin, as well as with principal organs, including the cardiovascular system, brain, digestive
tract and glands (Hartwig et al., 2014; Giudice and Taylor, 2017). In addition, some myokines
exhibit autocrine/paracrine actions in the muscle, thereby helping sustain its normal growth
(Pedersen and Febbraio, 2008). Considering the active interplay between SKM and other tissues,
the impact of physical inactivity on general metabolism can be envisaged. In short, lack of exercise

results in a lower insulin sensitivity, changes in the postprandial
lipid profile, and accumulation of visceral adipose tissue
(Pedersen and Febbraio, 2012). These effects are conceived
to be the result of an evolutionary positive selection of
pro-inflammatory pathways as well as of genes favoring
gluconeogenesis, insulin resistance and fat storage. While
formerly considered advantageous traits, in populations exposed
to famines and epidemics, they have turned into a burden
in modern ages, furthering cardiovascular diseases, because of
lifestyle changes (Tuomilehto et al., 2001; Nocon et al., 2008).

Not only does SKM adjust the individual’s metabolic activities,
but it also suffers the consequences of perturbations in the
systemic milieu. The SKM response to environmental cues is
regulated by the hypothalamus, which integrates endocrine and
immune signals, as well as information about physical activity
and nutritional state (Clegg et al., 2013). Thus, levels of some
nutrients –like glucose, fatty acids and amino acids– along with
leptin and additional adiposity-related hormones (Roh et al.,
2016) act as inputs for the elaboration of brain responses
controlling energy expenditure, food intake, insulin secretion and
glucose/fatty acid turnover in SKM (Roh et al., 2016). Muscle
homeostasis requires fine-tuning of both protein turnover and
cell growth in order to adapt its response to particular needs of
the individual, without affecting muscle mass balance.

There is a dramatical shift in SKM homeostasis toward muscle
loss during chronic inflammation. It is thought that an overacting
immune system can divert energy expenditure and lead to a
shortage of stored reserves affecting general metabolism (Straub,
2017). In spite of their relevance, these collateral effects are often
forgotten in the assessment of prevalent conditions, while there
is an increasing need of accurately measuring SKM response to
stress induced by a variety of insults. However, the pathogenesis
of systemic inflammation-related SKM damage, which has been
termed cachexia or more accurately sarcopenia, has not until
recently been understood. In this regard, sarcopenia can be
observed in chronic debilitating diseases, as well as in typical
inflammatory conditions, like rheumatoid arthritis, or in the
proximity of injured joints, as in the case of osteoarthritis. It can
also be the result of primary SKM autoimmune diseases. In the
same way that the precipitating conditions are quite distinct in

nature, so is the pattern of sarcopenia associated to them, while it
also depends on the severity of the injury. All these factors make
of sarcopenia a complex entity influencing general health which
should be addressed in the therapeutic management of diseases.

This article gives an overview on triggers and mediators of
SKM protein synthesis and cell turnover, especially focusing
on clinical situations associated to muscle loss. The impact of
systemic inflammation on muscle mass is discussed, looking into
the molecular signals which disrupt muscle homeostasis in the
different models of sarcopenia. In particular, the dual role of
the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription
(JAK/STAT) pathway is underlined.

MUSCLE PROTEIN TURNOVER

The major driver of SKM anabolic activity is the
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PIK3)/Akt signaling pathway.
Along with exercise, insulin and insulin growth factor (IGF)-1
can induce phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate
(IRS)-1 through the binding of specific receptors, subsequently
activating PI3K (Sandri et al., 2013). In turn, the end product
phosphatidylinositol-3, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (PI3P) facilitates
membrane anchorage of Akt and its phosphorylation by 3′-
phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK-1), upon
which Akt enables activation of the mechanistic target of
rapamycin (mTOR). The latter acts as downstream effector of
the anabolic pathway through both the stimulation of ribosomal
protein S6 kinase beta-1 (RS6K, or 70S6K), and the inhibition
of 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) (Glass, 2003) (Figure 1).
As we will discuss, Akt also shuts down the expression of
forkhead O (FoxO), a transcriptional activator of muscle-
specific E3 ubiquitin ligases involved in protein catabolism
(Mammucari et al., 2007; Schiaffino et al., 2013). On the other
hand, testosterone can induce muscle hypertrophy through the
PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway or also using androgen receptors
(Basualto-Alarcón et al., 2013; Hughes et al., 2016).

Conversely, myostatin (MSTN) –or growth differentiation
factor-8 (GDF-8)– is a member of the transforming growth
factor β (TGF-β) family, and a negative regulator of muscle
growth. The MSTN-Smad2/3 route inhibits Akt-dependent
protein synthesis and growth of mature muscle cells (Morissette
et al., 2009; Schiaffino et al., 2013; Brooks and Myburgh, 2014;
Retamales et al., 2015). This myokine binds to activin type 2
receptors (ACVR2) and promotes cachexia-related catabolism,
via FoxO-dependent induction of atrogenes (McFarlane et al.,
2006) (Figure 1). As it has been shown both in rodents and
humans, training acts as a MSTN repressor. This fact has been
put in relationship with the benefit of endurance exercise on
metabolism. On the other hand, both muscle and serum of obese
individuals appear to be comparatively enriched inMSTN (Hittel
et al., 2009).

Regulatory Networks of Protein Turnover
The concurrence of pro/anti-anabolic and pro/anti-catabolic
factors, not only within the muscle milieu but also in the systemic
environment, determines the yield of muscle turnover (Reed
et al., 2012; Schiaffino et al., 2013). Usually, up-regulation of

FIGURE 1 | Triggers and mediators participating in protein and cell turnover of the skeletal muscle. Insulin growth factor (IGF)-1, leads to insulin receptor substrate-1

(IRS-1) phosphorylation. Subsequently, Akt becomes phosphorylated and activates the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-C1, thus contributing to protein

synthesis and myoblast proliferation. Furthermore, Akt represses Forkhead O (FoxO), a factor that activates autophagy and the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS)

involved in protein catabolism. IRS-1 also activates the extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK), leading to satellite cell self-renewal and myoblast proliferation.

IL-6-dependent activation of STAT-3 contributes to myogenic differentiation and SC proliferation in homeostatic conditions. Myostatin (MSTN) activates Smad2/3,

which activates the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). Smad2/3 also inhibits the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, thus diminishing myoblast differentiation and

protein synthesis. UPS is also activated by Forkhead O (FoxO), p38 mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) and nuclear factor κB (NFκB), which also induces a

decay in MyoD mRNA, thus leading to a decrease in myoblast differentiation. IL-6-induced JAK2/STAT-3 signaling impairs myogenesis in a catabolic scenario.

protein synthesis is accompanied by a reduction of protein
degradation (Schiaffino et al., 2013). Likewise, under catabolic
stress, a well-orchestrated network blocks new protein synthesis
in order to limit energy expenditure. Nonetheless, if conditions
are favorable, the amino acids released during proteolysis will
boost new protein synthesis (Tran et al., 2007; Zoncu et al., 2011;
Perl, 2015).

The role of microRNAs in muscle anabolic fine-tuning is
noteworthy. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs which
act as negative regulators of gene expression. Muscle specific
microRNAs, known as myomiRs, target myostatin, TGF-β and
Akt-dependent pathways. In turn, these factors modify the
expression rate of different myomiRs (Butz et al., 2012; Hitachi
and Tsuchida, 2014; Jung and Suh, 2015). Their isolation from
muscle exosomes suggests that myomiRs can be released and
exert autocrine/paracrine actions in surrounding cells, in this way
facilitating a synchronousmuscle growth response (Demonbreun
and McNally, 2017; Fry et al., 2017).

CELL GROWTH

Myogenesis
Although anabolic factors have commonly a role in myogenesis,
processes of cell growth and protein synthesis have to be
considered as independent parts of the SKM metabolism. In
particular, myogenesis accounts for the capacity of cell renewal
and differentiation during repair processes.

This capacity is based on the existence of a niche of quiescent
myogenic cells, known as satellite cells (SC), between the
outer coat of sarcolemma and the basal lamina of myofibers
(Morgan and Partridge, 2003). These cells are characterized
by the expression of paired box transcription factor (Pax) 7
and myogenic factor (Myf) 5 and have a crucial role in self-
renewal of SKM. Upon injury, SC undergo proliferation and
differentiation into myoblasts (Pax7+/Myf5+/MyoD+), which
eventually lose expression of Pax7 and upregulate myogenin
(Pax7-/Myf5+/MyoD+/Myogenin+). The latter determines
cessation of cell proliferation and progression to terminal
differentiation, maturation and fusion of cells into newmyofibers
(Morgan and Partridge, 2003).

The JAK/STAT pathway and its triggering cytokine IL-6 stand
as key myogenic factors. The intracellular network exerts a
relevant homeostatic role in healthy SKM. Normal proliferating
myoblasts have been found to exhibit high levels of phospho-
STAT-3, both in vivo (Kami and Senba, 2002) and in culture
(Spangenburg and Booth, 2002; Yang et al., 2009). According
to the studies performed by Hoene and co-workers in primary
mouse myoblasts and in C2C12 cells, the activation of STAT-
3-SOCS-3 in response to an autocrine action of IL-6 is needed
for their differentiation (Hoene et al., 2013). In the same way,
IL-6 stimulation of STAT-3 is required for SC proliferation
following SKM overload. Moreover, not only does IL-6 stimulate
myogenesis, but it also exerts some key metabolic actions
(Pedersen and Febbraio, 2008; Muñoz-Cánoves et al., 2013) and

Pérez-Baos et al. Chronic Inflammation and Sarcopenia

blocks the production of pro-apoptotic cytokines like tumor
necrosis factor alpha (TNF) (Schindler et al., 1990). Altogether,
these actions place IL-6 as a pivotal myokine released from
muscle cells upon exercise.

Myoblast proliferation is subject to a tight control, which
prevents alterations in muscle mass volume during repair
processes (Verdijk et al., 2007; McFarlane et al., 2011; Fry et al.,
2015; Demonbreun and McNally, 2017). Experiments conducted
in the rodent C2C12 and L6 myoblast cell lines have shown
that IGF-1 plays opposite roles at distinct stages of myocyte
differentiation. While the peptide initially exerts a mitogenic
effect, it inhibits growth and promotes cell differentiation at
later phases (Engert et al., 1996; Florini et al., 1996). In
turn, these polar activities are driven by different signaling
pathways. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) appears to
be involved in cell proliferation (Rosenthal and Cheng, 1995;
Coolican et al., 1997), whereas PI3K/Akt/p70S6K has been shown
to mediate IGF-1-induced myogenin expression (Xu and Wu,
2000) (Figure 1). Similarly, the JAK/STAT pathway may promote
either proliferation or differentiation depending on themolecular
isoforms involved in its activation, as we will discuss (Sun et al.,
2007; Wang et al., 2008; Diao et al., 2009).

REGULATORY CATABOLIC PROCESSES

Metabolic disturbances and stress trigger numerous repair
mechanisms in SKM aimed at restoring homeostasis.
Intracellular proteolytic complexes, including calpains, the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, caspase cascades,
the autophagic machinery and the ubiquitin-proteasome system
(UPS) can participate in such response. Dysregulation and/or
perpetuation of these reparative mechanisms may result in
muscle wasting, either by increasing proteolysis or initiating
muscle cell apoptosis.

The Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS)
The UPS accounts for the principal mechanism of protein
degradation in muscle cells (Glass, 2010; Milan et al., 2015).
Two muscle-specific E3 ligases, muscle ring finger-1 (MuRF-
1) and muscle atrophy F-box protein (MAFbx) –or atrogin-1–
(Schiaffino et al., 2013) have been identified and their expression
is commonly used as a marker of UPS activity in secondary
sarcopenia models (Milan et al., 2015). UPS is regulated by
FoxO (Sandri et al., 2004; Tournadre et al., 2017), p38 mitogen
activated protein kinase (MAPK) (Zhang and Li, 2012), STAT-3
(Bonetto et al., 2012) and nuclear factor κB (NFκB) (Cai et al.,
2004). Furthermore, STAT-3 and NFκB down-regulate MyoD
expression, and, consequently, decrease myoblast differentiation
(Guttridge et al., 2000) (Figure 1). While FoxO is blocked by
Akt, the other mediators are activated in response to pro-
inflammatory molecules (Schiaffino et al., 2013). Notably, insulin
peripheral resistance, which shuts the IGF1-Akt pathway down,
also raises UPS activity (de Alvaro et al., 2004; Brown et al., 2009)
(Figure 1).

Autophagy
Autophagy is carried out by a cascade of proteolytic reactions
which degrade and recycle malfunctioning organelles, proteins

and other cytoplasmic molecules, using the lysosomal machinery
and a multimolecular complex (Mizushima and Komatsu,
2011). This highly conserved mechanism of homeostasis allows
cells to survive under stress conditions (Cuervo, 2008). In
addition, defects in autophagy associate with muscle disease
and inflammation (Levine and Kroemer, 2008). However, over-
induction of autophagy is also responsible for muscle loss.
Up to 35 different autophagy-related genes (ATG) encoding
the autophagy machinery have been found. The inhibition of
mTOR complex (mTORC)1 activates the initiation steps of
autophagy, inducing autophagosome nucleation and substrate
recognition. This is followed by the recruitment of different
ATG products that facilitate protease digestion of the cargo
(Portal-Núñez et al., 2015). Likewise, muscle mass can also
be regulated by mitochondrial dysfunction, ER stress or
myocyte apoptosis (Nagaraju et al., 2005; Busquets et al., 2007;
Nogalska et al., 2007; Marzetti et al., 2009, 2010; Deldicque,
2013).

Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) Stress
ER and mitochondria cooperate in SKM homeostasis.
Disturbances of their balance can be induced by protein
misfolding, starvation or energy deprivation, and lead to an
ER stress response. Consequently, ER activates the so-called
‘unfolded protein response’, consisting in the upregulation of
chaperones and other enzymes that participate in adequate
protein folding. If the insult persists, the stress response
can be unable to maintain cell homeostasis and give rise to
the activation of NF-κB and other inflammatory pathways.
Uncontrolled ER stress eventually lead to myocyte death by
mechanisms which include apoptosis, autophagy and necrosis
(Deldicque, 2013). Furthermore, it has been proposed that ER
stress could indirectly contribute to muscle wasting through the
blockage of mTORC1, thus creating a state of anabolic resistance
(Deldicque, 2013).

Apoptosis
Myofiber loss accounts for the key process leading to sarcopenia
during aging, skeletal muscle immobilization, muscular
dystrophy and other inflammatory conditions (Dupont-
Versteegden, 2006). The specific mechanisms of cell death
in SKM remain largely unknown and will not be addressed
in this review. Noteworthy, Dupont-Versteegden and co-
workers suggested that classical apoptotic pathways could be of
little relevance in muscle. Alternatively, additional molecules
might exert a key role in triggering regulatory cell death
processes (Dupont-Versteegden, 2006). Of note, being myofibers
multinucleated syncytia, nuclear elimination does not necessarily
carry cell destruction. In this regard, muscle loss can rely on loss
of myonuclei or of their associated cytoplasmic domains (Allen
et al., 1999).

SARCOPENIA, THE SKM RESPONSE TO
SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATORY STRESS

Systemic inflammation affects all body systems and organs,
including the SKM. Muscle response can follow different
patterns, namely primary sarcopenia, secondary sarcopenia, and

Pérez-Baos et al. Chronic Inflammation and Sarcopenia

those respectively found in osteoarthritis and in idiopathic
inflammatory myopathies. These four inflammation-related
clinical settings of muscle wasting are summarized in Table 1 and
will be addressed below.

Primary Sarcopenia
The condition known as primary sarcopenia (PS) is associated
with the aging and the frailty syndrome and is defined as a
progressive and generalized loss of SKM mass and/or strength
leading to a significant functional impairment (Cruz-Jentoft
et al., 2010). This muscle response is considered to be the
consequence of aging/disease interactions at multiple systems
(Cruz-Jentoft et al., 2010). Thus, PS identifies a poor health status
frequently associated with disability, increasing risk of falls and
fractures, and potentially dragging the elderly to dependence. On
these grounds, its appearance leads to a decreased life expectancy
(Cruz-Jentoft et al., 2010).

This type of sarcopenia represents a failure in
muscle anabolic processes. In addition, it is likely that
a mild persistent inflammatory status could play a
role in its pathogenesis, promoting a catabolic scenario
(Ali and Garcia, 2014).

Morphologically, atrophy of type II (fast-twitch, highly ATP-
consuming) fibers can be observed, following a loss of myocyte
proteins, organelles and cytoplasm size (Muscaritoli et al.,
2010), and the accumulation of muscle fat. The origin of PS
has been put in relationship with age-dependent functional
changes in mitochondria, ER, cells and tissues. Furthermore,
as suggested by studies conducted in aged mice, the niche
of SC could decline with age and be insufficient for nuclear
replacement (Brack et al., 2005). Additional factors are related to
lack of mobility, neurodegeneration, nutritional deficiencies and
hormone decrease. Progressive testosterone deficiency increases
peripheral resistance to insulin and IGF-1 –both potent activators
of the Akt/mTOR pathway– yielding a lower synthesis and a
higher degradation of muscle proteins, through the activation
of FoxO (Sandri et al., 2004). Likewise, an age-dependent
impairment in the GH/IGF-1 axis has been reported. A fall
in gene expression of GH receptors in the elderly inversely
correlates with serum MSTN levels (Perrini et al., 2010). This
fact could hamper both synthetic processes and cell renewal
(Taylor et al., 2001) –and the same effects could be expected
from the lowering of sex hormone levels –. Of all myokines,
IGF-1 is regarded as a pivotal mediator of muscle growth
because of its effect on SC proliferation, and its concentration
is inversely associated with the development of PS. However,
recent experiments have suggested that deficiency of GH/IGF-
1 could increase longevity in animals (Sattler, 2013). Indeed,
some human studies have also drawn controversial results, a
matter which has diverted the attention from the GH/IGF-1 axis
to MSTN up-regulation, as the cornerstone of the anti-anabolic
response of PS.

On the other hand, although clearly regarded as an anabolic
resistant process, there is also an age-related low-grade chronic
inflammation that may contribute to muscle wasting in PS (Clegg
et al., 2013) through the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory
cytokines, like TNF, IL-1 and IL-6 (Krabbe et al., 2004; Maggio

et al., 2006; Drummond et al., 2009; Ali and Garcia, 2014).
This view is supported by the finding of differential levels of
serum biomarkers between active and non-active elders, with an
enhancement of IL-8, myeloperoxidase and TNF in the latter
group (Marzetti et al., 2014).

Increased levels of IL-6 appear to be particularly associated
to a higher disability in the elderly (Barbieri et al., 2003; Maggio
et al., 2006). In spite of its homeostatic role in SKM, both driving
myogenesis and mediating IGF-I anabolic actions (Barbieri et al.,
2003; Maggio et al., 2006; Mammucari et al., 2007; Schiaffino
et al., 2013), over-expression of IL-6 is known to impair myocyte
functions (Roubenoff, 2014). Indeed, its levels along with those
of TNF-R1 out of a group of 15 different NF-kB-dependent
molecules, have been found to be the best predictor of mortality
in the elderly (Varadhan et al., 2014). Altogether this suggests that
the inflammatory response could account for a therapeutic target
in PS.

Secondary Sarcopenia (SS)
Secondary sarcopenia (SS) occurs in the context of chronic
illnesses, like cancer, renal/respiratory failure or inflammatory
diseases. A paradigm of this SKM response is rheumatoid
sarcopenia –or sarcopenia during rheumatoid arthritis– (RS)
(Morley et al., 2006; von Haehling et al., 2016). Sarcopenia is a
prominent feature of the more generalized rheumatoid cachexia
syndrome, thus termed because it targets major organs and
immune cells along with the SKM, leading to a profound loss of
cell mass in all these tissues. In this regard, two types of cachexia
have been associated to RA; the ‘classic’ type –which resembles
those found in cancer and AIDS– and shows both muscle and
fat mass loss, and the more typical ‘rheumatoid’ type –which
results in a reduced muscle mass but an increase in fat volume–
(Giles et al., 2008; Lemmey et al., 2009; Summers et al., 2010;
Tournadre et al., 2017). Other forms of SS are also frequently
referred to as cachexia (Roubenoff et al., 1992), due to their
predominant catabolic component (Masuko, 2014). However,
there are marked differences between RS and the other forms of
SS (Summers et al., 2010) because of the high inflammatory status
which characterizes RS, and the relevant role of the adaptive
immune system in this disease.

The prevalence of RS cannot be determined with accuracy,
largely due to a lack of consensus in establishing a clear cut-
off in body composition for its diagnosis. Besides, the syndrome
can pass unnoticed in patients with stable weight resulting from
the increase in fat volume, which can mask muscle mass loss
(Summers et al., 2010). It has though been estimated to be present
in 38% of patients with active rheumatoid arthritis and in 10–20%
of those with well-controlled disease (Elkan et al., 2009; Phillips
et al., 2009; Summers et al., 2010). The appearance of RS does not
carry the same poor prognosis as SS associated to AIDS or cancer.
Still, its development impacts both life expectancy and quality of
life, particularly due to its association with metabolic syndrome,
cardiovascular disease, and weakness, in an independent fashion
of disease severity (Kotler, 2000; Walsmith and Roubenoff, 2002;
Fukuda et al., 2013).

unchained by systemic inflammation. It appears that the
concurrence of a variety of signals triggers RS, the most relevant
of them being inflammation-driven increased metabolism, a
reduced anabolic activity, the coexistence of malnutrition,

peripheral insulin resistance and lack of exercise. Although RS
has not been primarily associated with an impairment of anabolic
processes, low IGF-1 has been shown to parallel muscle mass loss
in experimental models (Soto et al., 2001; Castillero et al., 2009a)

and also in the patients, after adjusting for age, sex, and adiposity
(Lemmey et al., 2009; Baker et al., 2015). In addition, it has been
proposed that rheumatoid arthritis-associated insulin resistance
indirectly promotes muscle wasting, because of the physiological
anti-catabolic effect of insulin (Walsmith and Roubenoff, 2002).
However, further studies are needed to clarify the involvement of
this pathway in RS (Lemmey et al., 2009).

Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-1β and IL-6, have
been proved to exert a critical contribution to the hypercatabolic
state found in these patients (Roubenoff, 2014). Although RS
pathogenesis is poorly understood, elevated serum levels of these
cytokines are known to activate UPS. In experimental cachexia,
an upregulation of muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligases MuRF-
1 and atrogin-1 has been shown, followed by an increased
myofibrillar proteolysis, through the activation of NF-κB (Li
et al., 2009; Varadhan et al., 2014; Little et al., 2017). These
data are consistent with the over-activation of UPS during
SS, as has also been found in muscle wasting associated to
experimental arthritis (Castillero et al., 2009a; Little et al., 2017).
In the same way, the increased activity of FoxO resulting from
MSTN-dependent PI3K/Akt inhibition enhances the expression
of atrogenes, thus promoting protein catabolism during cachexia
(McFarlane et al., 2006); however, the role of this transcriptional
regulator in RS is not well defined.

Our group recently conducted studies to look into muscle
response to chronic arthritis in a rabbit model which emulates
RS. The diseased animals had a reduction in weight and
muscle size, and an up-regulation of atrogin-1 both in muscle
and in synovium, altogether indicating an increased protein
breakdown. Strikingly, there was a paradoxical decrease inMSTN
expression, along with a reduction in phospho-STAT-3 levels,
which pointed to the existence of a compensatory anabolic
activation (Little et al., 2017). This pattern of response suggests
that the inflamed muscle could contribute to the process of
SS through a mechanism of autocrine atrophy triggered by the
release of muscle-derived, pro-inflammatory mediators (Little
et al., 2017).

It can be envisaged how devastating the effects of atrogenes
can be on the musculature of elderly RS patients (Guadalupe-
Grau et al., 2015). Also interesting is that both muscle mass loss
and IGF-1 content are remarkably returned to normal in patients
with RS following a high intensity training program (Lemmey
et al., 2009). This underlines the therapeutic goal of breaking
down anabolic resistance in RS. On the other hand, standard
antirheumatic therapies should not be expected to prevent RS,
since changes in body composition can be observed in patients
with low disease activity (Metsios et al., 2007). Previous work
in our laboratory disclosed a protective role of celecoxib in the
development of sarcopenia in rabbits (Romero et al., 2010). The
selective inhibition of COX-2, and COX-2 derived products such
as PGE2, yielded a reduction in both systemic inflammation and
NF-kB activation, together with an amelioration of weight loss in
arthritic rabbits. As suggested by previous studies, the inhibitory
effect of NSAIDs on NF-kB signaling might be responsible for
the suppression of muscle wasting induced by the activation of
the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Wyke et al., 2004).

As regards myogenesis impairment, there are no conclusive
data about its direct contribution to RS. Low MyoD and
myogenin levels have been observed in a rat model of
arthritis, arguing for this possibility (de Oliveira Nunes Teixeira
et al., 2013). In this regard, both TNF and IFNγ can impair
myogenesis, as shown in C2C12 myoblasts and in mouse
muscle, where the cytokines suppressed MyoD and myogenin
through an NFκB-dependent pathway (Guttridge et al., 2000). By
contrast, Castillero and co-workers showed increased expression
of these myogenic factors in arthritic rats (Castillero et al.,
2009a,b).

OA Sarcopenia
The effect of osteoarthritis (OA) represents a third subset of
muscle metabolic adaptive response to systemic inflammation.
A variety of factors are involved in the pathogenesis of this
complex syndrome, including biomechanical stress, senescence,
hormonal status and inflammatory mediators, while the genetic
background could also be relevant (Herrero-Beaumont et al.,
2009). While all joint tissues are targeted by OA, the initial
insult can be localized at any of them, and render different
syndromes (Roman-Blas et al., 2016). As the disease progresses
into advanced phases, the OA syndrome is usually more uniform,
although interspersed flares in relationship with acute injuries,
can occur (Castañeda et al., 2014). On the whole, the disease can
be considered a protean long-course process, with many possible
shifts of phenotype along time.

In the same way, inflammation in OA can take many
forms. Typically, there is a low-grade inflammatory status in
the OA joint, which can get temporarily higher in response
to different triggers, such as capsular sprains, micro-trauma,
and the presence of crystals or additional danger associated
molecular patterns (DAMPs). All these factors are known to
couple innate receptors, such as PI3K and the toll-like family
(TLRs) (Gómez et al., 2015). Alternatively, biomechanical sensors
can also contribute to these flares, since their signaling network
interlinks with major inflammatory pathways.

As regards OA-related sarcopenia, it does not only target the
neighboring muscles of affected joints but can also involve the
whole SKM. However, the underlying mechanisms regulating
joint-muscle crosstalk are not yet fully understood. A close
relationship between impaired SKM functions and knee OA has
been observed, along with an enhanced expression of FoxO1
reflecting lower muscle strength (Levinger et al., 2016). Since
cartilage and SKM cells share some cellular pathways, paracrine
communication between them remains conceivable, in addition
to the influence of a close anatomical proximity (De Ceuninck
et al., 2014). On the other hand, individual factors associated
to OA, such as lack of physical activity and obesity can play
an indirect role in the pathogenesis of OA-related sarcopenia,
while they also account for an increased cardiovascular risk
and a shortened life expectancy (Yoshimura et al., 2012).
This places adipokines as principal actors in this model of
SKM adaptive response to ‘low-grade inflammation’ (Scotece
et al., 2011, 2017). Adipokines are hormone-like fat-derived
factors which contribute to maintain the low-grade inflammatory

Pérez-Baos et al. Chronic Inflammation and Sarcopenia

status in patients with metabolic syndrome (Gómez et al.,
2015). Adiponectin and leptin are by far the best characterized
adipokines. They both stimulate glucose uptake and fatty acid
oxidation both in muscle and in adipose tissue (Kalinkovich
and Livshits, 2017). Of them leptin exerts a pro-inflammatory
role and adiponectin is mainly regulatory. While serum levels of
adiponectin decrease in relationship with OA, age and obesity,
serum leptin is enhanced in patients with OA in parallel with
the accumulation of adipose mass (Poonpet and Honsawek,
2014; Kalinkovich and Livshits, 2017). Other relevant adipokines
reported to be increased inOA are resistin (Koskinen et al., 2014),
which drives pro-inflammatory actions in human SKM (Carey
et al., 2006) and chemerin (Ma et al., 2015), which has been
shown to inhibit myogenesis and induce adipogenesis in C2C12
myoblasts (Li et al., 2015).

Both OA and sarcopenia are prevalent in the elderly (Felson
et al., 1987; Fielding et al., 2011). OA is frequently considered
as part of the metabolic syndrome and of senescence (Herrero-
Beaumont et al., 2009). The severe peri-articular sarcopenia
found in OA could be partly due to inactivity, but also due to
low-grade persistent systemic inflammation, which is a feature
of both syndromes (Krabbe et al., 2004; Scanzello and Loeser,
2015). In fact, sarcopenic obesity is more closely associated with
knee OA than non-sarcopenic obesity, thus supporting the tight
relationship between muscle metabolism and inflammation in
this disease (Lee et al., 2012).

It has been suggested that sarcopenia could not only be a
trigger of OA, but also a worsening factor for its progression (De
Ceuninck et al., 2014). Muscle transcription factors associated
to inflammation, such as STAT-3 and NFκB, correlate with the
grade of joint dysfunction, disability and gait impairment in the
patients (Levinger et al., 2011b). Similarly, an inverse correlation
has been observed between muscular resistance of hamstrings
and serum IL-6 levels in elderly women with OA (Santos et al.,
2011), suggesting a role for this cytokine in OA sarcopenia.
In fact, Levinger and co-workers found augmented levels of
IL-6, STAT-3, SOCS-3 and NFκB, among others, in the vastus
lateralis of patients with knee OA (Levinger et al., 2011a). The
relevance of IL-6 in OA pathogenesis is further sustained by
its association with cartilage loss and radiographic knee OA
(Livshits et al., 2009; Stannus et al., 2010). The cytokine could
therefore account for a pivotal link between OA and sarcopenia,
and provide an attractive therapeutic target, although further
research is warranted.

Sarcopenia Associated With Idiopathic
Inflammatory Myopathies (IMM)
Finally, a distinct pattern of muscle wasting can be observed in
patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IMM). These
systemic autoimmune diseases are characterize by weakness,
muscle inflammation (Day et al., 2017) and fat mass gain (Cleary
et al., 2015), without an increase in serum CRP levels (Hanisch
and Zierz, 2015; Malik et al., 2016). Both the innate and the
adaptive immune systems are involved in their pathogenesis.
On one hand, there is a deep disturbance in the adaptive
immune responses, with activation of auto-reactive cytotoxic T

cells along with production of autoantibodies (Dalakas, 2010).
On the other, an infiltration of inflammatory cells is responsible
for cell death, and disruption of the normal muscle architecture.
Local production of cytokines participates in IMM pathogenesis,
both promoting cell damage and impairing muscle cell function,
although some of them, such as IL-1, TNF or IL-15, appear to
have a role in repair stages as well. Therefore, the complexity
of muscle cytokine networks deserves especial attention at
designing therapeutic strategies (Loell and Lundberg, 2011). Also
to underline is the fact that muscle function restriction often
persists in the patients in the long-term, despite the achievement
of remission with immunosuppressive treatments (Loell et al.,
2016). There appears to be therefore a permanent footprint of a
previous muscle injury, which might also be present in the other
three subsets of sarcopenia.

In these heterogeneous muscle disorders myocyte
degeneration and necrosis occur mainly due to directed
self-reactivity of CD8+ T cells. Sarcolemma disruption provokes
the release of myoglobin and creatine kinase (Chargé and
Rudnicki, 2004). Antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes
(CTL) migrate through the endothelial wall and directly bind
to muscle fibers aberrantly expressing major histocompatibility
complex (MHC)-I molecules on their surface, through their
T-cell receptors. Upon presentation of muscle antigens, these
infiltrating CD8+ T cells undergo clonal expansion (Rayavarapu
et al., 2013). Histologically, affected muscles are characterized
by perivascular cell infiltration, predominantly consisting of
CD8+ T cells invading and surrounding healthy-appearing
muscle fibers. Direct cytotoxicity to muscle cells can then take
place through the release of perforin granules. Cell infiltration
is located in different regions of the muscle fascicles (i.e.
interfascicular septae, periphery of the fascicle, epimysium,
endomysium, etcetera) depending of the clinical subgroup
(Vattemi et al., 2014). Cytokines, such as IFN-γ, IL-1, and
TNF released by activated T cells, may enhance MHC class
I up-regulation and T-cell cytotoxicity. There is also a shift
toward Th17 CD4+ T cell differentiation, which furthers the
autoimmune process (Tews and Goebel, 1996). However, as
mentioned before, it has been reported that IL-1 and TNF
may exert a role in muscle regeneration (Loell and Lundberg,
2011). Some of the above-mentioned cytokines signal through
the NF-kB pathway and/or are controlled by this transcription
factor, which indeed seems to have a key pathogenic role in
IIM. It is well known that NF-kB becomes activated both in
inflammatory cells and in myocytes and enhances MHC-I
expression in muscle fibers. This event has been associated with
ER stress, which fuels MSTN production and muscle injury
(Tews and Goebel, 1996; Nagaraju et al., 2005; Nogalska et al.,
2007; Creus et al., 2009). As has been previously mentioned,
NF-kB is known to induce atrogene expression and loss of
MyoD messenger RNA (Guttridge et al., 2000; Cai et al., 2004).
On the other hand, MSTN exerts important anti-anabolic
effects by blocking the PI3k/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway
(Morissette et al., 2009; Schiaffino et al., 2013; Brooks and
Myburgh, 2014; Retamales et al., 2015). In conclusion, these pro-
catabolic and anti-anabolic mediators can elicit IIM-dependent
sarcopenia.

Pérez-Baos et al. Chronic Inflammation and Sarcopenia

THE DUAL ROLE OF JAK/STAT AND IL-6 IN
SKM

While the JAK/STAT pathway has been reported to play a crucial
role in myogenesis, its precise contribution to muscle wasting
and regeneration is yet to be defined. According to results drawn
by different studies, it can be argued that the activation of
JAK/STAT results in different effects in healthy and in injured
muscle cells. This is likely due to the magnitude and duration of
the induction.

As previously mentioned, the IL-6/STAT-3/SOCS-3 axis
contributes to myogenic differentiation in physiological
situations (Hoene et al., 2013). By contrast, experimental
murine models of rheumatoid cachexia exhibit a profound
total and muscle and total weight loss and elevated IL-6 levels
are consistently found along time. IL-6 involvement could be
determinant to muscle atrophy (Bonetto et al., 2012), and drive
muscle wasting through the activation of UPS (Bodell et al.,
2009). Furthermore, chronically elevated IL-6 levels might
reflect a feedback mechanism triggered by an impairment in
IL-6 dependent signaling. To our knowledge, whether this
phenomenon of ‘IL-6 resistance’ takes place during muscle
wasting has not been addressed. However, it is conceivable that
IL-6 deregulation during disease could follow a similar pattern
to those of insulin or leptin tissue resistance.

Hypothetically, during RS this phenomenon could be due
to an overexpression of SOCS-3 in muscle cells. Consistently,
muscle SOCS-3 overexpression is known to abrogate leptin-
dependent STAT-3 phosphorylation, in this way favoring leptin
resistance (Bjørbaek et al., 1998). Interestingly, increases in
SOCS-3 could also inhibit the insulin receptor, thus promoting
insulin resistance as well (Ueki et al., 2004). Also of interest would
be the assessment of soluble gp130/sIL-6R in RS muscle, since
this decoy receptor could account for an additional mechanism
of IL-6 hyporesponsiveness (Jostock et al., 2001). The conflicting
effects of IL-6 on muscle certainly represent a novel avenue for
further research, which could be termed the ‘IL-6 paradox’.

In line with this findings, Tierney et al. and Price et al. reported
that the enhancement of JAK2/STAT-3 signaling impaired
myogenesis in aging mice, likely due to a loss of SC self-renewal
capability (Tierney et al., 2014; Price et al., 2015). Subsequently,
STAT-3 has been hold responsible for driving SS. Bonetto and
co-workers found that STAT-3 and its responsive genes were up-
regulated in mice with cancer-associated cachexia (Bonetto et al.,
2011). In these mice, they found that constitutive activation of
the transcription factor worsened their wasting status, and that
JAK1/2 or STAT-3 blockade could revert this situation (Bonetto
et al., 2012). As has been shown in transfected C2C12 myoblasts,
overexpression of STAT-3 results in its direct interact with
MyoD, thus inhibiting myogenic differentiation. Reciprocally,
MyoD was shown to decrease STAT-3 activity (Kataoka et al.,
2003).

Although there are scant studies looking into this signaling
cascade in OA related sarcopenia, a role of the IL-6/STAT-
3/SOCS-3 axis in muscle wasting following ‘chronic low-
grade inflammation’ can be foreseen. Of note, in addition to
experimental findings, levels of these mediators were increased

in the vastus lateralis of patients with knee OA (Levinger et al.,
2011a).

Globally, these data point to a role of STAT-3 in normal
regeneration of healthy muscle. Nonetheless, its chronic
activation during aging or chronic inflammation could carry an
impairment of SC self-renewal, a lower proliferation of myoblasts
and an overall abnormal muscle repair.

Among all the JAK and STAT molecular mediators, STAT-3
has received major attention in the study of healthy and damaged
muscle. This transcription factor appears, nonetheless, to play
distinct roles on myogenesis depending on the JAK protein
kinase activated upstream. In brief, the JAK2/STAT2/STAT-3
pathway has been found to exert a pro-differentiation effect in
primary muscle cells and C2C12 myoblasts (Wang et al., 2008),
whereas JAK1/STAT-1/STAT-3 was shown to boost myoblast
proliferation through the regulation of cell cycle-associated
genes’ expression. As reported, the latter could also prevent
myoblast premature differentiation, thus acting as a checkpoint
during myogenesis (Sun et al., 2007). In a subsequent study,
the same group observed that SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 intercepted
JAK1/STAT-1/STAT-3 signaling, thereby promoting myogenic
differentiation (Diao et al., 2009).

Very little is known about JAK/STAT activation in IIM.
According to Illa and co-workers patients with dermatomyositis
could show an increased STAT-1 activation in myofibers (Illa
et al., 1997). Presumably, the enhancement of JAK/STAT
dependent transcription by local cytokine networks drives
muscle wasting in IIM. The overall extent of muscle wasting
is likely determined by activation of specific JAKs and STATs
triggered by a particular group of cytokines. Whether these
changes can be reverted with treatment, as well as the effects
of different JAK inhibitors depending on their specificity for
particular JAK/STAT cascades, deserves further research.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE
PERSPECTIVES

A tight regulation of protein turnover and cell growth is crucial to
maintain homeostasis in SKM. Chronic systemic inflammation,
however, provokes a dramatical shift in this balance, thus
compromising SKM mass. Behind this fine-tuning, there is
a very intricate network of catabolic and anabolic signaling
pathways, which are summarized in Figure 1. In short, induction
of the Akt/mTOR pathway not only enhances myogenesis and
protein synthesis, but also slows down catabolic UPS and the
autophagic machinery. Conversely, MSTN exerts important anti-
anabolic and pro-catabolic effects, through the suppression of
the Akt/mTOR axis and the induction of UPS, respectively.
Pro-inflammatory cytokines mostly act as pro-catabolic and
anti-anabolic factors, with IL-6 exerting a dual role in SKM
turnover.

It has not been until recently that the pathogenesis of
chronic inflammation-related sarcopenia has been understood.
Consequently, the SKM response to the inflammatory milieu is
often unadvertised in the assessment of prevalent conditions.
In addition, despite the recent advances providing insight on

Pérez-Baos et al. Chronic Inflammation and Sarcopenia

the relationship between chronic inflammation and sarcopenia,
there are still substantial gaps, which may account for the lack
of treatments for sarcopenia. Intriguingly, muscle mass loss
does not seem to revert despite the achievement of remission.
Therefore, the mechanisms behind this permanent footprint need
to be approached in future studies.

While innate and adaptive immune responses are extremely
energy-consuming, metabolic inflammation does not lead to
an increased energy expenditure. Notwithstanding this fact,
metabolic inflammation is often said to resemble a smoldering
fire, which is difficult to extinguish (Hotamisligil, 2006).
Moreover, chronic low-grade inflammation and metabolic
dysfunction drive the development of the most prevalent
chronic diseases, particularly those targeting the musculoskeletal
system such as OA (Hotamisligil, 2006; Robinson et al., 2016).
Of interest, they also significantly contribute to the fragility
syndrome of the elderly. As is widely acknowledged,major factors
associated with accelerated atherosclerosis are the components of
the metabolic cluster, namely hypertension, high blood glucose,
excess in waist fat, and abnormally increased lipid levels. Obesity,
which shows a higher prevalence in OA than in non-OA
age-matched individuals, could be the most relevant of these
traits.

Additional pathways of muscle loss are unchained by
anorexia, asthenia and inactivity, all of which are typical features
of chronic systemic inflammation (Phillips et al., 2009). These
processes are, in fact, shared by the four previously mentioned
clinical settings (Huffman et al., 2017). In this regard, as has
been recently reviewed in depth by Dalle and coworkers, exercise
and dietary interventions have proved beneficial against the
anabolic resistance of the elderly (Dalle et al., 2017). On the other
hand, considering the impact of chronic inflammation on the
development of this resistance, it appears that anti-inflammatory

therapies could provide an extra benefit to lifestyle and nutrition
changes on restoring muscle mass in the aged population (Dalle
et al., 2017). Similarly, not only suppression of disease activity but
also exercise and a well-suited nutritional management have been
underlined as major strategies against RS (Masuko, 2014).

An increasing attention is being currently paid to the
JAK/STAT pathway as a promising target for the treatment
of muscle wasting diseases. The product of this signaling
cascade seems to differ, likely depending on the magnitude
and duration of the input. It would be of high interest to
assess therapeutic effects of JAK/STAT inhibitors not only on
inflammatory parameters, but also on muscle mass and function
both in clinical and preclinical studies, since they certainly stand
as promising drugs in the management of sarcopenia.

On the whole, to look into muscle involvement in distinct
types of systemic conditions may help identifying patterns of
muscle classic inflammatory response (i.e. IMM), low-grade
chronic inflammation (i.e. PS or OA) or severe chronic systemic
inflammation (i.e. RS).

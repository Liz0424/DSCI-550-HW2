The purpose of the study was to determine the signal transduction mechanism of cepharanthine hydrochloride (CH) on reversing
tumormultidrug resistance. RT-PCR andWestern blot analysis were used to determine the effects of CH on the expression ofMDR1
mRNA and P-glycoprotein in K562/ADR cells when CH was used alone and combined with SP600125, a JNK inhibitor, to explore
the effects of CH on JNK pathway. Western blot analysis was used to determine the effects of CH on c-Jun protein expression
and phosphorylation, to explore the regulating effects of CH on c-Jun and phosphorylated c-Jun (p-c-Jun) proteins. Our results
showed that the inhibitory effect of CH on MDR1 mRNA increased with the concentrations of CH (5.0, 10.0, and 20.0𝜇M) and
the inhibitory effects of CH on MDR1 mRNA and P-glycoprotein increased with the incubation time of CH (0, 12, 24, 36, and
48 hours). The inhibitory effect was weakened after CH combined with SP600125. The expressions of c-Jun and p-c-Jun proteins
increased with the incubation time of CH (0, 6, 12, and 24 hours).These findings suggest that CH downregulated the expressions of
MDR1mRNA and P-glycoprotein in a time and concentration manner; the mechanism may be mediated via activating c-Jun/JNK
pathway.

1. Introduction

Chemotherapy is one of the main treatment strategies for
cancer patients currently. However, it is more and more
serious that the multidrug resistance (MDR) occurred in the
cancer patients as the anticancer drugs arewidely used, which
affected the patients’ treatment directly. The overexpression
of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), encoded by multidrug resistance
geneMDR1, is one of the important mechanisms involved in
MDR [1–3]. For that reason, it is a problem that should be
solved quickly to search for MDR reversor and improve the
chemotherapy sensitivity for medicine academia currently.

Natural source compounds have become the new trend
of discovering the fourth-generation P-gp inhibitors because

they are less toxic and more potent than the disappointing
previousMDRmodulators [4–6]. Cepharanthine hydrochlo-
ride (Figure 1), manufactured by salification from cepharan-
thine (CEP), which is a biscoclaurine alkaloid, extracted from
Stephania cepharantha Hayata, has a reversed effect involved
in multimechanisms from our previous studies [7–9]. In
recent years, it is reported that CH has MDR-reversing effect
and one of the reversing mechanisms is to inhibit the P-gp
expression and function in MDR cancer cells [10, 11].

Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family has a
vital role to play in regulating gene expression. c-Jun NH

terminal kinase (JNK) is one of the members of MAPK
family. Growing evidence suggests that JNK is closely related
to the occurrence ofMDR [12–14].The signals relayed by JNK

through c-Jun regulate a range of cellular processes including
cell proliferation, tumorigenesis, apoptosis, and embryonic
development. MDR1 gene is also regulated through c-Jun
in transcriptional level [15, 16]. Therefore, a new possible
therapeutic target of reversing MDR and improving the
effectiveness of chemotherapy is to regulate JNK pathway.

To the best of our knowledge, it remains unclear whether
JNK associates with the regulation and expression of P-
gp by CH on reversing MDR. The purpose of the study
is to determine the signal transduction mechanism of CH
on reversing MDR in the human chronic myeloid leukemia
Adriamycin-tolerance K562/ADR cell line.

2. Methods

2.1. Reagents. CH was provided by Henan Academy of
Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences (Zhengzhou, Henan,
China). SP600125 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St.
Louis,MO,USA). RPMI-1640 was purchased fromLife Tech-
nologies (Grand Island, NY, USA). Anti-P-gp, c-Jun, p-c-Jun,
and anti-𝛽-actin primary and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-
conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). ECL detection
kit was purchased from Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology
(Jiangsu, China).

2.2. Cell Lines and Cell Culture. K562 cells and K562/ADR
cells were purchased from Shanghai Institutes for Biological
Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China).
The two cell lines were cultured in RPMI-1640 culture
medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37∘C in a
humidified atmosphere of 5% CO

2
. When the cells reached

confluency, they were harvested and plated for either subse-
quent passages or drug treatments.The trypan blue exclusion
test was used throughout the experiments to check cell
viability.

2.3. Cell Growth Inhibition Assay. Chemosensitivity in vitro
was measured by MTT assay. Briefly, the cells were harvested
in exponential growth and seeded into 96 well plates at a
density of 2.0 × 104 cells per well in a final volume of 180 𝜇L
with or without 5 𝜇Mof CH or VER. After a 48 h incubation,
20𝜇L of MTT was added to each well and further incubated

for 4 h. The resulting formazan was dissolved with 200𝜇L of
dimethyl sulfoxide after aspiration of the culture medium.
The plates were shaken for 5min with a plate shaker and the
absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a Bio-Rad ELISA
plate reader (Bio-Rad, CA, USA). The fractional absorbance
was calculated by the following formula: % cell survival =
(mean absorbance in test well)/(mean absorbance in control
wells) × 100%. IC

50
was calculated from the cytotoxicity

curves. The degree of resistance was calculated by dividing
the IC

50
for the MDR cells by that for the parental sensitive

cells. The reversal fold of MDR was calculated by dividing
the IC

50
for cells to the anticancer drug in the absence of the

modulator by that in the presence of the modulator.

2.4. RT-PCR Analysis. To study the effects of CH on MDR1
mRNA expression, the K562/ADR cells at a density of 1 ×
105/mL in exponential growth were exposed to 5.0, 10.0, and
20.0𝜇M of CH for 48 h or were exposed to 10.0 𝜇M of CH
for 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. For the investigation of the effects of
CH on JNK signal transduction pathway in mRNA level, the
K562/ADR cells were treatedwith 10.0𝜇MofCHor 2.0𝜇Mof
SP600125 along or CH plus SP600125 for 48 h.The total RNA
isolationwas performedwith TRIZOL (Invitrogen, USA). All
RNA preparation and handling steps took place in a laminar
flow hood, under RNAse-free conditions. The isolated RNA
from each fraction was dissolved in 20 𝜇L of RNAse-free
water and stored at −80∘C until used. cDNA synthesis was
performed at 37∘C for 15min and 85∘C for 5 sec using
the Primer Script RT reagent Kit (TaKaRa Biotechnology,
Dalian, China) in a total volume of 20𝜇L according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The primers sequences used for
amplification of MDR1 and GAPDH were shown in Table 1.
The PCR cycling conditions comprised a denaturation step
for 5min at 95∘C, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation
(94∘C for 15 s), annealing (58∘C for MDR1 and 57∘C for
GAPDH for 30 s), and extension (72∘C for 30 s). After the last
cycle, all PCR products were subjected to a final extension
for 5min at 72∘C. PCR products were combined and then
electrophoresed on 1.5% agarose gels containing ethidium
bromide. Autoradiographic films of the RT-PCR assays were
subjected to densitometric analyses using a KODAK Gel
Logic 100 Image Station (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY,
USA).

2.5. Western Blot Analysis. To study the effects of CH on
c-Jun and phosphorylated c-Jun (p-c-Jun) expression, the
K562/ADR cells were treated with 10.0𝜇M of CH for 6,
12, and 24 h. For the investigation of the effects of CH
on JNK signal transduction pathway in protein level, pro-
tein extracts for gel-electrophoresis were made from the
cells treated as above according to standard techniques.
Briefly, proteins were solubilized and then fractionated by
sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE). Western blotting analysis was performed by
a slight modification of the method described previously
[17]. Polyvinylidene fluoridemembraneswere incubatedwith
primary antibodies (diluted 1 : 1,000): Pgp, p-c-Jun, c-Jun, and
𝛽-actin. The membranes were washed and incubated with
HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (diluted 1 : 2,000) for

kit.

2.6. Statistical Analysis. Data are the means ± SD from
triplicate samples of at least three independent experiments.
Differences between the mean values were analyzed by two-
sample Student’s 𝑡-test and one-way analysis of variance; the
results were considered statistically significant when 𝑃 <

3. Results

3.1. Effect of CH on Reversing MDR In Vitro. The K562/ADR
cells were approximately 31-fold resistant to ADR in com-
parison with the K562 cells. In drug-resistant K562/ADR
cells, coincubation of CH with ADR resulted in a significant
increase in the cytotoxicity of ADR; the IC

50
dropped drasti-

cally from 13.97±0.30 to 1.62±0.10 𝜇M.While coincubation
of the same concentration of VER resulted in a slight increase
in the cytotoxicity of ADR, the IC

50
shifted to 6.07±0.18 𝜇M.

However, this effect of CH or VER was not observed in
parental K562 cells (Table 2).

3.2. Downregulation of MDR1 mRNA and P-gp by CH. RT-
PCRanalysis showed that the level ofMDR1mRNAdecreased
significantly after treatment with 10.0 𝜇Mof CH (Figure 2(a))
and the level of MDR1 mRNA partially decreased by 5.0 𝜇M
ofCHand completely by 20.0 𝜇MofCH in 48 h (Figure 2(b)),
suggesting the downregulation of MDR1 mRNA by CH in a
time- and concentration-dependency. Western blot analysis
showed that the level of P-gp decreased progressively from
24 to 48 h in a time-dependent manner after treatment with
10 𝜇M of CH (Figure 2(c)).

JNK activity is required for the downregulatory effect by
CH onMDR1mRNA and P-gp.

We then examined whether the downregulation of P-
glycoprotein by CH required JNK activity. After the cells were
treated with 10.0 𝜇M of CH plus the JNK inhibitor SP600125
(2.0 𝜇M) for 48 h, the levels of MDR1 mRNA and P-gp
increased comparedwith that in the cells treatedwith 10.0𝜇M
ofCHalone usingRT-PCRandWestern blot analysis (Figures
3 and 4), suggesting that SP600125 inhibited CH-induced
downregulation of MDR1 mRNA and P-gp expression in
terms of both mRNA and protein level.

3.3. CH Induces Activation of JNK in K562/ADR Cells. We
sought to further confirm the above-mentioned findings by
analyzing the transcription factor c-Jun and the substrate for
JNK using Western blot. After treatment of the K562/ADR

cells with 10.0 𝜇M of CH, c-Jun and phosphorylation-c-Jun
(p-c-Jun) protein levels began to rise from 6 h (Figure 5),
suggesting that CH increased both phosphorylation and
expression of c-Jun in a time-dependent manner.

4. Discussion

MDR is complex biological processes that involve many
MDR transporter proteins, genes, and signal transduction.
Although researches have advanced greatly in MDR, it
remains a formidable problem in clinical treatment. Statistics
show that cancer deaths are on the rise all around the
world and there will be more than over 11 million cancer
deaths by 2020 [18]. More than 90% of all cancer deaths
are considered to be associated with MDR [19]. A lot of
researches currently are just focusing on a certain kind of
resistance mechanisms designed to block the MDR, which
may not be completely reversed. On the contrary, a research
according to the different mechanisms simultaneously may
be more effective to reverse the MDR.

In recent years, CH or CEP has been reported to induce
apoptosis of human leukemia cell line and hematoma cell
line [20], decrease the activation of GST-𝜋 and NF-𝜅B, and
increase the activation of DNA Topo II to reverse MDR,
suggesting that the reversing effect of CH involves multi-
mechanisms. In recent years, the relationship between signal
transduction pathway and MDR is becoming a hot research
area gradually. Recent evidence indicates that pumping out
xenosubstance is an important defense mechanism of the
cell responding to stressful stimuli, while the regulation of
MDR1 expression often involves stress reaction and signal
transduction [21], for example, JNK and NF-𝜅B. JNK is
a stress-activated protein kinase that can be induced by
inflammatory cytokines, bacterial endotoxin, osmotic shock,
UV radiation, and so on. It has been reported that NF-𝜅B
and JNK are functionally interconnected; activation of NF-
𝜅B inhibits the activation of JNK and vice versa [22]. Our
previous study has demonstrated thatCHhasweak antitumor
effect [23]; other researchers reported that the effect was
related to inhibiting the activation of NF-𝜅B [24]. In the
meanwhile, the NF-𝜅B inhibition effect is one of the MDR
reversing mechanisms of CH [11]. In view of this, we further
investigated whether CH plays its P-gp inhibition effect is
related to regulating the JNK pathway.

SP600125, a reversible ATP-competitive inhibitor, specif-
ically inhibits activation of the JNK in response to a variety
of stress stimuli [25, 26]. In order to determine whether acti-
vation of JNK is directly associated with the P-gp expression
in K562/ADR cells, we sought to block JNK activity using

SP600125 and to determine the effect on the extent of inhibit-
ing P-gp expression induced by CH. Our results showed
that both the MDR1 mRNA and P-gp expression increased
after CH co-incubated with SP600125 in K562/ADR cells,
suggesting CH induced MDR1 mRNA and P-gp expression
down-regulation is implicated in activating JNK. c-Jun is
a protein that forms the activator protein 1 (AP-1) early
response transcription factor. It is well known that c-Jun can
be activated through double phosphorylation on serine 63
and 73 by the JNK pathway but has also a phosphorylation-
independent function [27, 28]. The data presented here
showed that CH promoted c-Jun expression and phospho-
rylation in K562/ADR cells in a time dependence manner,
suggesting that c-Jun may be play an important role in
downregulation ofMDR1 and P-gp expression.

gp expression was abolished partly when combined with SP600125

It is worthwhile to note that the role of JNKpathway in the
development of MDR is debated. Sui et al. [29] reported that
inhibition of JNK downregulates the expression ofMDR1/P-
gp in resistantHCT8/V cells.While our results are in linewith
those in the papers by Zhou et al. [13], Miao and Ding [15],
that is, the activation of JNK is related to the downregulation
of MDR1/P-gp expression. This may reflect a complicated
nature ofMDR1/P-gp regulation by JNKwith the involvement
of P-gp modulators.

In conclusion, these results for the first time demonstrate
that CH downregulates MDR1 mRNA and P-gp expression
by activating JNK/c-Jun. However, other signaling molecules
may be also involved in the regulation of the activity of JNK

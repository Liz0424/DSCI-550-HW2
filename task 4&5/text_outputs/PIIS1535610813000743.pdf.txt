SUMMARY
The fibroblast growth factor (FGF)/fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signaling network plays an
important role in cell growth, survival, differentiation, and angiogenesis. Deregulation of FGFR signaling
can lead to cancer development. Here, we report an FGFR inhibitor, SSR128129E (SSR), that binds to the
extracellular part of the receptor. SSR does not compete with FGF for binding to FGFR but inhibits FGF-
induced signaling linked to FGFR internalization in an allostericmanner, as shown by crystallography studies,
nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, free
energy calculations, structure-activity relationship analysis, and FGFR mutagenesis. Overall, SSR is a small
molecule allosteric inhibitor of FGF/FGFR signaling, acting via binding to the extracellular part of the FGFR.
INTRODUCTION

Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) constitute a major class of

drug targets (Overington et al., 2006). Most efforts have been

invested in developing agents that orthosterically compete for

binding between RTKs with their endogenous ligands, such as

Mechanism of SSR to Allosterically Block FGFRs
By using a high-throughput scintillation proximity binding

assay (SPA), we identified compounds that inhibited binding of
125I-FGF2 to the extracellular domain of FGFR1, comprising three

immunoglobulin-like domains D1–D3 coupled to an Fc-fragment

(FGFR1-D1D2D3/Fc). After screening >105 compounds and

chemical optimization, one compound (SSR128129E, abbrevi-

ated as ‘‘SSR’’) inhibited 125I-FGF2 binding with mM affinity,

although this effect was not saturated (Bono et al., 2013). These

findings suggested amodulation in fibroblast growth factor (FGF)

binding but not necessarily binding competition. Further, SSR

reduced FGFR phosphorylation but did not cross the plasma

membrane, while inhibiting cell proliferation at nM potency. The

discrepancy of the inhibition constants between the SPA results

and proliferation assay led us to investigate the molecular mech-

anisms of SSR. Pharmacological experiments showed that this

compound inhibited FGF receptor (FGFR) signaling via an allo-

steric mechanism (Bono et al., 2013), which we studied in more

molecular detail here.

RESULTS

SSR128129E Inhibits FGFR andBinds to Its Extracellular
Domain
We identified SSR128129E, referred to as ‘‘SSR’’ (Figure 1A),

which inhibited the binding of 125I-FGF2 to the extracellular

domain (ECD) of FGFR1 at mM concentrations in a SPA assay

(Bono et al., 2013). SSR dose-dependently inhibited the survival

of endothelial cells (ECs) (IC50 < 30 nM; Figure 1B).

Since SSR’s effects on FGFR signaling did not result from an

inhibition of FGF binding to FGFRs (Bono et al., 2013), impaired

dimerization of FGFRs or FGF ligands (Figures S1A and S1B
490 Cancer Cell 23, 489–501, April 15, 2013 ª2013 Elsevier Inc.
available online), or TK inhibition (Figure 1C), we used satura-

tion transfer difference (STD)-nuclear magnetic resonance

(NMR) to analyze if, after FGFR irradiation, the NMR signal (satu-

ration) would spread to SSR, which would indicate that SSR

interacts with FGF. However, SSR did not bind FGF1 or FGF2

(Figure S1C).

We assessed if SSR bound FGFR-ECD, in which D2 and D3

constitute the major binding site for FGFs and coreceptors.

STD-NMR showed that SSR bound all constructs containing

D2 and/or D3 (Table S1). Figure 1D shows the STD-NMR spectra

of FGFR1 and FGFR4 with SSR. Together with the functional

assays, these data suggest a direct (orthosteric) or indirect

(allosteric) inhibition of FGF binding to ECD of FGFR and/or the

biological function of the receptor.

SSR Inhibits FGF-Induced Signaling and Endocytosis
Pathways
To dissect how SSR interfered with FGFR, we studied its effect

on ERK1/2 activation and FGFR endocytosis. SSR blocked the

FGF2-induced increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Figure 2A)

and translocation of cell surface FGFR4 to the cytosol (Fig-

ure 2B). In addition, SSR inhibited the FGF2-induced intracellular

accumulation of early endosomal antigen1 positive (EEA1+) vesi-

cles, the destination of internalized FGFRs (Figures 2C and 2D).

Similar effects of SSR on FGFR internalization and phosphoryla-

tion of FRS-2 (target of FGFR2) and ERK1/2 were observed in

human gastric SNU-16 cancer cells, in which these processes

rely on FGF7/FGFR2 (Figures 2E and 2F), and in FGFR2-overex-

pressing L6 cells (see below). Blockage of FGFR internalization

could explain the inhibition of FGFR signaling, though other opin-

ions exist (Belleudi et al., 2007; Reilly et al., 2004).

Mechanism of SSR to Allosterically Block FGFRs
Structural Properties of Extracellular FGFR Domains D2
and D3
To map the interaction site of SSR with FGFR-ECD, we first

generated two-dimensional (2D) 15N-HSQC NMR spectra of

FGFR-ECD in the absence of SSR to obtain the protein’s finger-

print. Peaks in this spectrum correspond to amide groups (and

nitrogen-containing side-chains). Since chemical shift perturba-

tions (CSPs) of these peaks are sensitive to the chemical envi-

ronment, this technique allows identification of SSR interaction

sites with FGFR-ECD.

The spectrum of D2 showed sharp peaks and spectral disper-

sion, as expected for a well-folded domain with defined struc-
ture, and all NMR resonances were assigned to a particular

residue. In contrast, the signals of D3 could not be detected,

because they were broadened beyond detection, indicating

that D3 does not adopt a stable, persistent three-dimensional

(3D)-fold (Figures S2A–S2F). This behavior is consistent with

a transiently unfolded flexible state, a phenomenon confirmed

by D30s high tendency to aggregate (data not shown). Because
this behavior can be an inherent property of the domain or,

alternatively, a preparation artifact compromising the analysis

of a potential interaction with SSR, we generated preparations

of functional, structured D3. However, optimization of condi-

tions to solubilize D3, variations of D3 constructs (with/without

membrane or D2D3-Linker), or attachment of solubilizing fusion

constructs (thioredoxin, protein G) all failed to yield spectra

consistent with a stable D3 fold, while the other domains re-

mained readily detectable (Figures S2A–S2D).

Such a very flexible (intrinsically disordered; Tompa, 2011)

state of proteins can be characterized by computer simulations

that estimate the preferred conformational state and stability of

various parts of the protein. We therefore performed multi-ms-

long, unbiased, all-atom, explicit-solvent molecular dynamics

(MD) computer simulations with the Amber99SB*-ILDN force

field. In line with NMR data, D3 was marginally stable and

partially disordered in solution. The Thr319-Arg330 region, which

has an extended b-conformation in the crystal structure, tended

to adopt an a-helical conformation and to detach from the

protein core, leading to partial unfolding of the domain. Plasticity

of this region, in particular of the bC0-bE loop (Pro307-Val332)
plays a key role in the specificity of FGF binding to FGFR splice

variants (Beenken and Mohammadi, 2009). Noteworthy, the

algorithm AGADIR also predicted a propensity for a helix confor-

mation of the Thr319-Arg330 region, thus independently confirm-

ing the MD computer simulations.

To assess if the flexibility of D3 corresponds to a completely

random (random coil) or compact but unfolded (molten globule

[MG]) state and to verify the chemical purity and quality of the

protein used in the NMR experiments, we performed FGFR2-

D2D3 crystallization trials. We resolved a similar structure of

the FGFR2-FGF1 complex, as reported (Plotnikov et al., 1999;

Schlessinger et al., 2000). A defined electron density of D3 re-

vealed a stable structure, suggesting that D3 is only marginally

unstable and ready to fold in conditions of crystallization and/

or upon forces taking place in the crystal. These observations

are compatible with a molten globule state of D3 (in line with

the increased aggregation propensity and disappearance of

NMR peaks). Control experiments showed that the amino acid

composition of the urea-unfolded D2D3 polypeptide chain

was correct (Figures S2E and S2F), that D3 folding was not en-

forced by crystallization conditions (Figures S2G and S2H),

and that D2D3 interactedwith FGF1 (Figures S2Gand S2I). Since

the crystal structure indicates that D2 and D3 are needed to

interact with FGF (Plotnikov et al., 1999; Schlessinger et al.,

2000), these findings show that D3 is present and functional.

Thus, D2 is well folded, while D3 is in an unfolded MG state

that is ready to fold.

Mode of Action of SSR: Effects on D2
We then explored to which sites SSR binds in the FGFR ECD and

used 2DNMR to determine the CSP values upon addition of SSR

to D2 of FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR4. SSR-induced CSPs were

mapped on the X-ray structure of FGF2/FGFR1-D2D3/heparin

(Protein Data Bank [PDB] code 1FQ9; Schlessinger et al.,

2000). The CSPs suggested a conserved binding site of SSR in

the vicinity of—but not overlapping with—the heparin binding

site of D2 (red balls show residues interacting with SSR in D2

of FGFRs; Figures 3A and 3B). Chemical shift titration analysis

yielded a binding affinity of SSR to D2 of FGFR1, �2 and �4 in
the mM range (Table S2). These affinities are two to three orders

of magnitude too low to explain the mM SPA data. Moreover, the

computational estimation of the free binding energy of SSR to

FGFR2-D2 (�5 kcal/mol) is in line with the mM range of the
492 Cancer Cell 23, 489–501, April 15, 2013 ª2013 Elsevier Inc.
observed KD values (Figure 3C). Thus, an interaction of SSR

with D2 alone cannot account for the cellular effects.

We therefore performed binding experiments with FGF/FGFR

complexes. Since NMR signals only appear if the protein is

labeled with 15N isotope, FGFR or FGF was labeled separately

to dissect to which component SSR binds. The effect of

SSR on the 2D NMR spectra of (15N)FGFR2-D2D3/FGF1 and

FGFR1-D1D2D3/(15N)FGF2 is shown in Figure 3D and mapped

on the crystal structure 1FQ9 in Figure 3E. The spatial CSP clus-

tering indicates a binding site for SSR at the interface between

D2 and FGF, in agreement with the binding of SSR to D2 alone.

Confirming STD-NMR experiments that SSR does not bind to

FGF1 or FGF2, SSR induced CSPs in FGF only when a FGF/

FGFR complex was formed. When analyzing the complex

between FGFR1-D1D2D3 and (15N)FGF2, two additional CSPs

were observed: Asn101 (facing D2 in crystal structure 1FQ9)

and Ala57 (facing D3; black circle in Figure 3E, bottom), suggest-

ing an additional binding site for SSR in D3. To evaluate SSR’s

affinity for FGFR/FGF, we performed NMR titration experiments

of FGF1/FGFR1-D1D2D3 with SSR, yielding an affinity constant

in the low mM range (�50 mM; Figure 3F). Due to the structural
disorder of D3, a binding mode could not be deduced. Together,

the CSP data indicate a binding site on the interface between

FGF and D2 and a potential binding site on D3. A role for D3 in

SSR binding is supported by the mM affinity of SSR to D2 alone,

too low to explain the biological effect.

Mode of Action of SSR: Low Resolution FGF-FGFR
Crystals
To further assess themolecular basis of the allosteric interaction,

we performed X-ray crystallography. Crystals of FGF1/FGFR2-

D2D3 complexes with SSR could not be optimized to a suitable

diffraction quality, but it was possible to generate crystals with

SR128545 (abbreviated as ‘‘SR’’; Figure S3A), a SSR analog

with comparable cellular activity (Figure S3B). Limited by a

diffraction resolution of 4.2 Å, the exact binding position of SR

could not be visualized, but conformational protein backbone

changes induced by the interaction with SR were detectable.

Molecular replacement (MR) statistics of Phaser (McCoy et al.,

2007) were used to compare the observed X-ray diffraction

pattern to existing 3D models. This revealed single solutions

without structural clashes when independently using the three

separate domains (FGF1, FGFR2-D2, and FGFR2-D3) of the

FGF1/FGFR2/heparin crystal structure (PDB code 1E0O; Pelle-

grini et al., 2000). These results confirm that the obtained crystal

structures were in agreement with published results (PDB codes

1CVS and 1DJS). We also analyzed the translation function

Z-scores (TFZ), as they are a measure of how well the MRmodel

fits to X-ray data (a high score indicates a good match). TFZ

scores in the presence of SR were smaller for D3 than for D2

or FGF1 (FGF1/SR = 23.1, FGFR2-D2/SR = 15.7, and FGFR2-

D3/SR = 7.5), showing that the structure solution cannot explain

the entire scattering pattern in the presence of SR but rather

suggests a structural change induced by SR.

To confirm the above findings and to determine conforma-

tional dynamics, we refined the structure of the FGFR2-D2D3/

FGF1/heparin/SR complex by generating polyalanine models

using Refmac5 to obtain a model that best explains the experi-

mental data (Murshudov et al., 1996). The electron density of

separate deletion of single domains in the PDB file. In the

differences. However, strong differences in the Debye-Waller

observed. Surprisingly, the average B-factor of the X-ray protein

of atoms, resulting in high B-factors (Figure 4A). Together,

Mode of Action of SSR: Effect of SSR
on FGFR-D3
The finding of an intrinsically disordered D3

domain in NMR studies andMD simulations

together with the SR-induced increase of its

B-factors in the X-ray structure led us to

further investigate the influence of SSR on

D3 using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)

spectroscopy and in silico methods. By ob-

taining an infrared spectrum of absorption,

FTIR provides information on the transition

from one to another conformation. Addition

of SSR to FGFR2-D2D3 increased the

amplitude of the amide I band in the FTIR

spectrum with a maximum at 1,640 cm�1

(Figure 4B), suggesting that binding of

SSR leads to a conformational change of

FGFR-D2D3 (similar results were obtained

when analyzing FGFR2-D1D2D3), in agree-

ment with the AGADIR prediction.

We used state-of-the-art free energy (DG)

calculations and computer modeling to

unravel how the conformational landscape

and flexibility of D3 changed in the presence

of SSR. The free energy calculations were

performed with the Gromacs 4 package

and PLUMED plug-in using metadynamics,

bias exchange metadynamics, and steered

MD approaches and the Amber99SB*-ILDN

force-field (Best and Hummer, 2009; Piana

and Laio, 2007). Similar techniques were

used previously to predict the free energy

landscapes associated with conformational

changes and ligand binding in kinases

(Lovera et al., 2012; Saladino et al., 2012).

Comparison of the free energy landscapes
of D3 as a function of the b sheet and a helix content predicted

that SSR stabilizes helix a1 (Thr319-Ile324) and induces a b sheet

to a helix transition of part of b5 (Gln325-Ile329), thereby nearly

doubling the number of turns in helix a1. As a result, D3

undergoes a conformational rearrangement into an intermediate



Cancer Cell

Mechanism of SSR to Allosterically Block FGFRs
‘‘H1’’ state, which progresses to state ‘‘H2,’’ where a new hydro-

phobic cavity, not accessible in the native form of D3, is formed,

in which the hydrophobic Tyr328 residue (solvent exposed in the

native configuration) now faces the core of D3 (Figures 4C and

S3C). The difference in free energy between the crystallo-

graphic fold of D3 and the refolded H2 state, calculated by two

independent approaches (bias exchange metadynamics and

steered MD simulations) was 2 to 3 kcal/mol. These data, in

agreement with NMR and X-ray observations, suggest that D3

binds SSR and undergoes conformational rearrangements

without becoming fully structured in the SSR-bound state.

Mode of Action of SSR: Helix-Breaker Mutations
To assess the importance of Tyr328 in the conformational

changes of FGFR-D3, we mutated this residue to aspartate,

which has known ‘‘helix-breaker’’ properties (to yield FGFR2-

D2D3Y328D, termed FGFR2Y328D), as this mutation should reduce

the helical tendency and impair the conformational change.

Indeed, we hypothesized that the hydrophilic Asp328 would

destabilize the a-helical conformation and that SSR would not

be able to induce a conformational change in FGFR2Y328D.

FTIR revealed that FGFR2Y328D did not exhibit a major shift in

its spectrum in the absence of SSR, showing that its overall 3D

configuration was preserved. Conformational analysis by FTIR

showed, however, that SSR failed to induce a change in the

spectrum of FGFR2Y328D (Figure 4B). This effect was specific,

as additional mutations of the Y328 residue (Y328R/I329K) still

showed the same structural change as FGFR2WT upon addition

of SSR, illustrating that not any type of mutation of Y328 per se

could rescue the SSR effects (data not shown).

The aforementioned observations suggest that SSR does not

directly compete with FGF binding, but rather that it alters the

conformational ensemble of FGFR-ECD, which allosterically

propagates into receptor function changes. The b to a transition

of the b5 helix (Glu325-Ile329) is critically involved in this allosteric

effect. To assess the relevance of Tyr328 in transmitting SSR’s

allosteric activity, we generated HEK293 cell lines expressing

wild-type FGFR2WT or mutant FGFR2Y328D. In the absence of

SSR, FGFR2WT and FGFR2Y328D cells exhibited a similar

ERK1/2 response to FGF2, showing that the mutation did not

change FGFR’s response to FGF. The mutation did also not alter

orthosteric binding of 125I-FGF2 (KD: 54 ± 8 pM for FGFR2
WT

versus 52 ± 9 pM for FGFR2Y328D; n = 5; p = NS). However,

SSR’s ability to inhibit FGF2-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation

was reduced in FGFR2Y328D cells (IC50 value: 121 ± 30 nM) as

compared to FGFR2WT cells (IC50 value: 28 ± 12 nM; p < 0.05)

(Figures 5A and 5B). Similar data were obtained for FGFR2 phos-

phorylation and phospho-FRS2 signaling (Figures 5C and 5D).

We also stably overexpressed FGFR2WT or FGFR2Y328D in L6

myoblast cells (which lack endogenous FGFRs). Transduced

cells were treated with AlexaFluor488-conjugated FGF2, leading

to the formation of FGF2/FGFR2 at the cell membrane and its

internalization in endocytic vesicles. Upon stimulation, FGFR2WT

and FGFR2Y328D were comparably endocytosed (Figures 5E and

5F). Notably, SSR reduced endocytosis in FGFR2WT but not in

FGFR2Y328D cells (Figures 5E and 5F). To unravel the endocytic

pathway, inhibitors of clathrin- (Pitstop2) and caveolin-depen-

dent (Dyngo-4a) pathways were used. Only Dyngo-4a affected

endocytosis of FGFR2WT and FGFR2Y328D, indicating that the
FGF2 endocytic pathway relies on caveolae-dependent internal-

ization (Figures 5E and 5F), consistent with previous reports

(Irschick et al., 2013). Thus, FGFR2WT and FGFR2Y328D showed

similar profiles with respect to FGF2 affinity, ERK1/2 phosphor-

ylation, and receptor internalization, but SSR inhibited signaling

more efficiently in FGFR2WT than FGFR2Y328D cells. Thus, by

altering the b to a transition of the b5 strand and thereby elon-

gating the a1 helix, SSR modulates inhibition of FGFR signaling

and internalization.

Mode of Action of SSR: Binding of SSR to D3 H2
Because of the flexibility in D3, we performed in silico binding

studies using metadynamics, a recently developed method to

dock ligands on receptors in water solution, allowing protein

flexibility (Laio and Gervasio, 2008). This revealed that the free

energy of binding to the hydrophobic cavity in the H2 state

was �10.2 kcal/mol (Figure 6A), reflecting tight binding in the
nM range. Overall, very long all-atom MD simulations and free

energy calculations with metadynamics confirmed that SSR

alters the flexibility and conformational propensity of D3. The

stability of the helical region in FGFR2-D3 is enhanced by an

initial step of low-affinity SSR binding, thereby making a new

metastable H2 state accessible, which is stabilized by docking

of SSR (Figures 6B–6D and S3C). Superposing D30s structure
in its SSR-boundH2 state with previously identified crystal struc-

ture of FGFR2-D2D3 showed that the FGF-interacting residues

remain unaffected, in line with findings that SSR did not alter

the affinity of FGFs.

In addition, free energy calculations showed that FGFR2Y328D

underwent helix elongation and adopted the conformational

state H2, though H2 was less stable. This relates to the fact

that stabilization of the cavity is largely due to interactions of

the hydrophobic Tyr328 with the core of D3 and that these inter-

actions are highly unfavorable in FGFR2-D3Y328D, in which the

hydrophilic Asp328 prefers solvent exposure rather than buried

conformations. Our finding that Y328D reduces but does not

eliminate SSR binding explains why FGFR2Y328D is still capable

of binding SSR but also why its signaling is inhibited less by SSR.

Structure-Activity Relationship Analysis
Experimental and computational approaches suggest a noncon-

ventional allosteric regulation of FGFR function by binding of

SSR to the disordered ensemble of D3. MD simulations outline

the major structural features of the H2 state and schematic

features of the arising binding cavity. To further probe themolec-

ular details of the D3-SSR interaction, we analyzed the structure

activity relationship (SAR) of a set of 19 SSR analogs by com-

paring their biological activity (inhibition of phospho-ERK1/2

signaling) to their capacity to dock into the in silico-identified

binding pocket of D3 (H2 state) using the Schrödinger Glide XP

package on the nonflexible H2 state of FGFR2-D3. As shown

in Table S3, two active SSR analogs inhibited ERK1/2 phosphor-

ylation with a comparable efficiency as SSR (IC50 � 10–100 nM);
their activity was reduced in FGFR2Y328D cells (Table S4), con-

firming the specificity of their activity. Six other compounds

had weak biological activity (IC50 � 100–1,000 nM), while
another tenmolecules were inactive (IC50 > 1,000 nM). One com-

pound could not be tested because of insolubility. Docking ex-

periments showed that the binding energy generally correlated

with biological inhibition and that the binding strength of the

active compounds was significantly higher than of the weak

and inactive compounds (Figure S4A).

Computational modeling suggested that several critical

substitutes were adjacent to residues in the Thr319-Arg330 region

(i.e., R1 and R2 in the vicinity of Leu327-Tyr328-Ile329 and R0

and R00 pointing toward Thr319-Thr320-Glu323-Ile324; Figure 7A).
More detailed analysis revealed the following insights (Table

S3): (1) R0 group: a carboxylate group (or amide bioisostere) at
R0 is required for full biological activity (compound 7); changing
this group abrogated SSR’s activity (compounds 10–13,16);
496 Cancer Cell 23, 489–501, April 15, 2013 ª2013 Elsevier Inc.
switching the carboxyl group at R0 and the
aniline group at R00 retains residual activity
(compound 5), likely because of sufficient

docking, but this configuration is less favor-

able because one charge-charge interac-

tion (with Lys279) and a H-bond between

neutral groups (Thr319, Thr320) are replaced

with H-bond interactions between charged

and neutral groups; (2) R00 group: the aniline
group is required as its removal (compound

4 and 17) or monomethylation (compound 6)

lowered the activity, in line with the observa-

tion that these compounds had reduced

polar and H-bond interactions in the H2

state; (3) R1 group: switching the methoxy

group for a carboxyl group prevents dock-

ing into the H2 pocket (compound 11), but

this group can be replaced by a hydrogen

atom without losing activity (compound 3),

highlighting the need for hydrophobic

interactions not compatible with negative
charge; and (4) R2 group: the methyl group can be substituted

by a cyclopropyl group, retaining potency consistent with com-

parable hydrophobic interactions with the pocket (compound 2).

These data confirm that the Thr319-Arg330 region is important

for SSR binding and transduction of the allosteric information.

Noteworthy, the R1 moiety facing Tyr328 is critical, explaining

why SSR binding and inhibitory activity were impaired by the

bulky methoxybenzamide and methoxybenzenesulfonamide

at R1 (compounds 17 and 18). Likewise, the bulky CONHMe

at R6 (compound 8) is not tolerated, probably because of

steric clashes with the hydrophobic pocket. Other substitutions

abrogated the function, even though they did not interfere much

with binding itself, which is compatible with the allosteric mode

of action, in a sense that not binding per se but rather the confor-

mational change induced by the SSR derivative matters.

On a subset of active, weak, and inactive compounds (Table 1),

we performed biophysical (STD-NMR and waterLOGSY-NMR;

Bretonnet et al., 2007) experiments to assess their binding

capacity to FGF1/FGFR2-D2D3. Also, to allow flexibility of

protein movements, we calculated the free binding energy (DG)

of these compounds using metadynamics, which, in contrast to

standard modeling on a rigid structure, also takes into account

movements of the protein. The agreement between the calcu-

lated DG and biological activity is superior to that obtained with

the Glide XP score (Table 1; Figures 7B and S4B). For instance,

when we subtract the thermodynamic penalty of state H2

(2 to 3 kcal/mol) from the calculated binding free energies, we ob-

tained �8/�9 and �9/�10 kcal/mol for SSR and compound 2,
which is in very close agreement with the expected value of

�8.5 kcal/mol for compounds in the 100 nM affinity range. An
agreement is also obtained for weak and inactive compounds.

The superior agreement of the free energy (calculated by Meta-

dynamics) over the docking scores (calculated by Glide XP)

stresses the importance of considering flexibility and explicit

water hydration.

This view is also supported by NMR measurements, in which

STD and waterLOGSY NMR were used to rank binding of this

subset of compounds (Table 1). The NMR data are in good

agreement with the calculated binding energy values and bio-

logical potency. Two compounds from

the active group bound the strongest,

and SSR itself was the third strongest

binder, which also underscores that,

besides binding strength itself, the

compatibility with the structural allosteric

transition is also important for the effect

of the compound. Again, adding large

groups at R1 induces the most profound

effect (compound 17 being the weakest

and compound 18 being undetectable
by NMR due to protein precipitation). Overall, the binding

affinity of SSR variants and their allosteric effect of binding

generally correlate: the stronger a derivative binds, the more it

drives the conformation of the receptor toward the inhibited

ensemble.

DISCUSSION

In the accompanying paper (Bono et al., 2013), we identified

SSR, a synthetic inhibitor of the FGF tyrosine kinase receptor,

and provided pharmacological evidence for an allosteric mech-

anism. This orally deliverable, small-molecule, multi-FGFR inhib-

itor showed promising therapeutic anticancer efficacy (Bono

et al., 2013). SSR does not affect orthosteric FGF ligand binding,

cannot penetrate the membrane, and does not directly block the

TK activity but exhibits typical pharmacological allosteric fea-

tures. Indeed, the compound shows signaling bias by inhibiting

ERK1/2 activation (relying on FGFR internalization) without alter-

ing phospholipase C (PLC)-g phosphorylation, has a ‘‘ceiling’’

effect, and exhibits ‘‘probe dependence’’ (Bono et al., 2013).

All these findings suggest an allosteric conformational effect

that discriminatively affects the readout of receptor activation.

In this study, efforts were made to unravel the molecular mech-

anisms of the allosteric activity of SSR. The challenge in these

investigations is due to both the complexity of the FGFRs and

the disordered, even unfolded nature of domain D3, which is

prone to aggregation, invisible to NMR, and highly flexible in

the X-ray structures in the presence of SSR.

(C) Under normal conditions, heparin sulfate-bound FGF (orange circle) binds to FGFR ECD via D2 (green) and D3 (red). While D2 is well folded, D3 is in

a disordered native (N, probably corresponding to amolten globule) state. The receptor can dimerize and induce distinct intracellular signaling pathways, such as

receptor internalization (leading to ERK1/2 phosphorylation) and PLC-g phosphorylation. Due to its inherent flexibility, D3 can transit to an alternative disordered

state (H1), which is more open and competent for weak SSR binding. From this state, there is a transition to a third disordered state (H2), which binds SSR

stronger. In this state, SSR does not inhibit FGF binding or dimerization, but, due to altering the conformational ensemble and/or dynamics of D3, it inhibits

receptor internalization. Allostery of the system arises from SSR acting indirectly via long-range conformational effects in the disordered ensemble, attenuating

membrane interaction.

See also Figure S4 and Tables S3 and S4.

Cancer Cell

Mechanism of SSR to Allosterically Block FGFRs
At first, it may appear surprising that a small molecule like SSR

is capable of inhibiting the responses of various FGFRs to

multiple FGF ligands if steric hindrance of the orthosteric FGFR

pocket was the desired mode of receptor targeting. However,

an allosteric interaction with a small molecule can perturb the

signaling of a large FGF ligand by inducing a conformational

change in FGFR. The model that emerges from computer simu-

lations and modeling reconciles the experimental findings by

predicting a marginally stable D3 fold, a weak SSR binding site

on D2, and a conformational change in D3 in the presence of

SSR. The AGADIR software also independently predicted

a conformational preference of a helix over b sheet structure.

The conformational change gives rise to a new hydrophobic

cavity, to which SSR can bind. A mutation that reduced the

a-helical propensity in this region was predicted to suppress

the SSR-induced conformational changes in silico and indeed

counteracted SSR’s ability to inhibit FGFR-driven cellular

processes.

The key element of the model is the allosteric nature of SSR’s

action. Whereas this molecule was selected by using the SPA

assay for FGF binding and has nM pharmacological effects, it

does not interfere with FGF binding or receptor dimerization in

a cellular context. Because SSR is not internalized, it acts on

the extracellular part of the receptor. Direct SSR binding to

FGFR was indeed demonstrated experimentally, as was the

conformational change that is critical for affecting receptor func-

tion. Allostery also follows from the ‘‘ceiling’’ effect, the differen-
498 Cancer Cell 23, 489–501, April 15, 2013 ª2013 Elsevier Inc.
tial effect on distinct downstream signaling pathways, and

‘‘probe dependence’’ (Bono et al., 2013). All these observations

can be reconciled with data from structural experiments and

modeling calculations in the followingmodel: (1) an SSR-induced

conformational rearrangement of D3 is suggested by most tech-

niques; (2) structural disorder of D3 is confirmed by NMR, MD

simulations, and high-crystallographic B-factors; and (3) defec-

tive receptor internalization in the presence of SSR is shown in

cellular assays and suggested by differential pharmacological

effects.

Therefore, the structural underpinning of the system is that the

actual structural state of domain D3 is probably a conformational

ensemble corresponding to a MG state, with a global topology

resembling the structure stabilized in crystallography. This

domain thus falls into the growing family of intrinsically disor-

dered proteins, which lack well-defined stable folds, yet play

key regulatory and signaling roles in many cellular processes

(Tompa, 2011). Its dimerization, even without a folding transition,

can be envisaged, as in fuzzy complexes (Tompa and Fuxreiter,

2008) such as T-cell receptor zeta (Duchardt et al., 2007; Sigalov

et al., 2004). As is the case with MG states, its various conforma-

tions are in an intermediate kinetic exchange regime that causes

severe line broadening in NMR, making it invisible to the NMR

(Park et al., 2011).

The native ensemble of D3 samples the minor state H1, in

which the b5 region tends to adopt local helical conforma-

tions; this structural state is stabilized by weak interactions

Cancer Cell

Mechanism of SSR to Allosterically Block FGFRs
with SSR, as indicated by an increase of B-factors upon

SR binding, MD simulations, and FTIR. Local helical conforma-

tions are also underlined by AGADIR predictions. Overall, this

transition is compatible with the ability of small molecules to

bind to the disordered state, as observed in the inhibition of

Myc-Max heterodimerization (Metallo, 2010). The SSR-FGFR

interaction is likely heterogeneous, as suggested by the failure

of observing electron density for the bound SR in the crystal

structure.

MD simulations suggest that, upon transition to this transient

and heterogeneous complex, a hydrophobic cavity becomes

exposed, in which Tyr328 plays a key role. This transient complex

may then relax into a more stable structural ensemble (H2), in

which SSR is buried in the hydrophobic cavity (Figure S3C).

This results in amuch stronger interaction, which does not inhibit

FGF binding but alters FGFR signaling, possibly due to inter-

fering with membrane binding and/or internalization (Figure 7C).

Disorder of this state is confirmed by increased crystallographic

B-factors in the SR-complex and MD simulations and is also

compatible with the allosteric nature of regulation of the re-

ceptor. Transitions in the ensemble N / H1 / H2 translate

into different interactions with the membrane and/or different

dynamics and orientations of receptor subunits in the dimer, re-

sulting in inhibition of receptor internalization but not PLC-g

phosphorylation. In all, this scenario is fully compatible with

recent concepts of allostery, which emphasize the importance

of changes in dynamics without alteration of the equilibrium

conformation (Tzeng and Kalodimos, 2009), and/or redistribution

of the ensemble of intrinsically disordered protein structures

(Hilser and Thompson, 2007). The outcome of these transitions,

as seen in in cellulo assays, is an inhibition of slow and irrevers-

ible FGF-dependent receptor endocytosis abolishing ERK1/2

phosphorylation. A similar allosteric mechanism was described
for the ganglioside GM3 and EGF receptor; the latter is closely

related to FGFR (Coskun et al., 2011).

The allosteric effect was also confirmed by SAR analysis,

which shows a good correlation of binding free energies of

various SSR derivatives and their allosteric inhibition calculated

by metadynamics modeling, while the docking scores, with their

known limitations, also have an overall correlation with biological

activity. This behavior would be fully incompatible with an

orthosteric competitive inhibition of FGF binding and can be

best explained by a binding model in which the allosteric activity

of the compound stems from its ability to induce the proper shift

in the conformational ensemble of the receptor. In most cases,

altering substituent R1, which faces Tyr328, impairs the allosteric

activity of the compound, which points to the importance of this

residue in the allosteric transitions.

Mutagenesis studies of Tyr328 are also in line with this conclu-

sion, because the Tyr to Asp replacement does not basically

affect the D3 structural ensemble, leaving its FGF-binding

capacity and dimerization intact. On the other hand, it reduces

the capacity of the structure to sample the local helical confor-

mations, characteristic of H1 (and H2) states, thus altering SSR

binding and its ability to interfere with signaling. This is in line

with our FTIR experiments, MD simulations, and cellular assays.

In addition, this disorder-based binding and allosteric mecha-

nism is also compatible with the relaxed specificity of SSR,

which is capable of interfering with different FGFR variants in

distinct species. This would be difficult to reconcile with a well-

folded (preformed) binding cavity on D3, which would limit

FGFR isoform specificity toward SSR. Adaptability of the struc-

tural ensemble of intrinsically disordered proteins in binding is

observed in many cases (Dunker et al., 2008). A corollary of

this conserved allosteric regulation in all FGFR structures is

that the receptor may have endogenous regulatory compound(s)

Mechanism of SSR to Allosterically Block FGFRs
that act by a similar mechanism; identifying thesemoleculesmay

open exciting avenues of FGFR research.

A final word is due on the difference of Ki values observed in

the distinct in vitro and in vivo experiments. Such an enhanced

response to small-molecule effectors in vivo is often observed

(Hanoulle et al., 2007; Huppa et al., 2010), probably due to

cellular conditions, such as the presence of additional (protein)

factors or the vicinity of the membrane. The latter is probably

signaled by the preferential inhibitory effect on receptor internal-

ization rather than PLC-g phosphorylation. In the case of FGFR,

this effect may be augmented by the structural sensitivity of the

conformational ensemble of the D3 domain.

What are the possible implications of this study? From a

structural biology perspective, our study provides insight in

fundamental mechanisms of how FGFRs transmit signals and

provides unprecedented evidence for allosteric regulation of

growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases. We show the impor-

tance of taking into account target flexibility in order to under-

stand the mode of action of allosteric ligands. In addition, from

a biopharmaceutical perspective, our results unveil the thera-

peutic potential for FGFR antagonists, perhaps wider than previ-

ously attributed to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, since SSR blocks

not one but multiple FGFRs and because allosteric modulators

are considered to have an improved benefit/risk ratio and to offer

opportunities for fine-tuning biological responses in a manner

that is not attainable with classic orthosteric modulators (Chris-

topoulos, 2002). Finally, our results show that development of

orally deliverable selective allosteric inhibitors of growth factor

receptors is feasible, which creates formidable therapeutic

opportunities for the future.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Compound Reconstitution

SSR was stored as pure powder at 4�C in the dark. For the different assays,
SSR was dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 100 mM and stored at

�20�C until further use. SU5402 (Calbiochem) was also dissolved in DMSO
at a concentration of 10 mM and stored at �20�C. For each assay, the same
amount of DMSO was used for the control condition.

Materials

FGF1 and FGF7 were purchased from R&D Systems and FGF2 was produced

and purified in-house. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) are

single-donor HUVECs from Promocell.

Cell Survival

Apoptotic cells were detected using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated

annexin V. Each assay was performed in triplicate and repeated three times.

FGFR2 Kinase Assay

Kinase activity measurements of the recombinant catalytic domain of FGFR2

was done using the ADP-Glo Kinase Assay and the Cyclex FGFR2 Kinase

Assay/ Inhibitor screening kit (Sanbio, Uden, The Netherlands) according to

the manufacturer’s protocol.

Confocal Microscopy Studies

EEA-1 labeling was performed on HUVECs or SNU-16 cells starved for 24 hr in

1% fetal bovine serum containing medium and stimulated for 2 hr with FGFs

diluted in prewarmed medium without fetal calf serum in the presence or

absence of SSR. Cells were then rinsed with cold PBS and fixed for 15 min

with paraformaldehyde 4% and then permeabilized with PBS-Triton 0.1%

for 5 min. Following washing with cold PBS, nonspecific sites were saturated

with 1% normal goat serum (Zymed) in PBS for 1 hr at room temperature.

Early endosomal vesicles were detected using mouse anti-human EEA1

antibody (1/100, BD Biosciences) overnight at 4�C and revealed with
AlexaFluor488-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1/2,000, Invitrogen) for 2 hr

at 4�C. Wells were rinsed twice with 1 ml PBS. Then, all liquids were removed
and one drop of Fluoprep (Biomerieux) was added and mounted with a round

coverslip (KnittelGläser). Confocal microscopy views were performed with

a Zeiss LSM510. The number of EEA1-positive vesicles around the nucleus

was counted with Columbus software (PekinElmer). For FGF-R4 staining,

HUVECwere only fixedwith DakoCytomaton kit following supplier recommen-

dations. FGF-R4 was detected with primary anti-FGFR4 MAB685 (1/100, R&D

Systems).

Western Blot Analysis and Phosphoproteome Profiler Array

These studies were realized on 24 hr-starved cells that were then stimulated

for 7 min with FGFs in the presence or absence of SSR. Immunoblots were

carried out with anti-phosphoprotein antibodies against FGFRs (Santacruz

Biotech, Sc30262), FRS2 (Cell Signaling Tech., 3864), Erk1/2 (Cell Signaling

Tech., 4377), or anti-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)

(Cell Signaling Tech., 2118). The proteome array was run in accordance with

supplier recommendations.

FTIR Measurements

FTIR was performed using a Bruker Tensor 37 FTIR spectrometer equipped

with an AquaSpec flow cell. The sample compartment was thermostatted to

25�C and 100 spectra were averaged for a good signal-to-noise ratio. Proteins
were purified as described in Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Imme-

diately after the gel filtration, the proteins were dialyzed overnight in the same

preparation of buffer (10 mM 4-[2-hydroxyethyl]-1-piperazineethanesulfonic

acid pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl) in the presence or absence of SSR. Dialysis buffer

samples were used to subtract background signal. The analysis was per-

formed using the OPUS software package provided by Bruker.

STD- and 1D-NMR Measurements

All STD- and 1D-NMR experiments were carried out on a BRUKER three-

channel DRX600 and on a BRUKER four-channel DRX800 spectrometer at

the standard temperature of 298 K and were referenced to the internal

standard 3-trimethyl-2,2,3,3-tetradeuteropropionate sodium salt. A detailed

description has been included in the Supplemental Information.

Crystals of FGF1/FGFR2 D2D3 complexes with and without SR/SSR com-

pounds could be obtained under crystallization conditions containing 0.1 M

with SSRdiffracted up to 6 Å, whereas SRbound crystals diffracted up to 4 Å at

SLS Villingen. Data could be integrated using XDS and phased with Phaser,

using MR of separate domains FGF1, FGFR2 D2, and FGFR2 D3 of the crystal

structure 1E0O. Because of bad resolution, all residues were mutated to

alanine. The poly-A backbone model of FGF1/FGFR2 D2D3 was refined using

Refmac5 and Coot.

In Silico Molecular Modeling and Metadynamics Modeling

All the detailed procedures are in the Supplemental Information.

Other Assays

For methods such as cell proliferation, survival, FGFR kinase assay, confocal

microscopy, FTIR, and western blotting, we used standard protocols that are

detailed in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.

Statistics

All data represent the mean ± SEM of the indicated number of experiments.

Statistical significance was calculated by Student’s t test, considering

p < 0.05 as statistically significant.

ACCESSION NUMBERS

The low resolution polyA backbone model of the FGFR2D2D3/FGF1/

SSR128545 complex has been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank

under the ID code rcsb077498 and PDB ID code 4J23.

In Figure 2F, the authors failed to highlight clearly that there is a split in thewestern blot (all rows) between the ‘‘0’’ and ‘‘0.1’’ condition.

Even though all samples were run in the same experiment on the same blot, the image was split to remove samples that were

simultaneously analyzed but irrelevant for this study. In the corrected Figure 2F, the authors have now clearly separated both parts

of the western blot.

In Figure 5B, the image of the western blot showing total FGFR2 for the HEK293-FGFR2Y328D cell line was mistakenly replaced with

the image of the western blot showing total FGFR2 for the HEK293-FGFR2WT cell line from Figure 5A. In the corrected Figure 5B, the

authors have included the correct image of the western blot showing total FGFR2 for the HEK293-FGFR2Y328D cell line.

The corrected Figure 2 and Figure 5 are included below. The authors apologize for any confusion these mistakes may have caused

the readers.

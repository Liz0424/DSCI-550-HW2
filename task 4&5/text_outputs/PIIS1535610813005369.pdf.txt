SUMMARY
Coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1), a coactivator for various cancer-relevant
transcription factors, is overexpressed in breast cancer. To elucidate the functions of CARM1 in tumorigen-
esis, we knocked out CARM1 from several breast cancer cell lines using Zinc-Finger Nuclease technology,
which resulted in drastic phenotypic and biochemical changes. The CARM1 KO cell lines enabled identifica-
tion of CARM1 substrates, notably the SWI/SNF core subunit BAF155. Methylation of BAF155 at R1064 was
found to be an independent prognostic biomarker for cancer recurrence and to regulate breast cancer cell
migration and metastasis. Furthermore, CARM1-mediated BAF155 methylation affects gene expression by
directing methylated BAF155 to unique chromatin regions (e.g., c-Myc pathway genes). Collectively, our
studies uncover a mechanism by which BAF155 acquires tumorigenic functions via arginine methylation.
INTRODUCTION

Coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1),

also known as PRMT4, is a type I protein argininemethyltransfer-

ase (PRMT) that asymmetrically dimethylates protein substrates

on arginine residues. CARM1 was originally identified as a coac-

tivator for steroid hormone receptors (Chen et al., 1999). CARM1

knockout (KO) mice die at birth (Yadav et al., 2003), showing

that CARM1 is specifically required for postnatal survival. Inter-

estingly, methyltranserase-inactivated CARM1 knockin mice

phenocopy CARM1 null mice, indicating that CARM1 requires

Emerging evidence implies oncogenic functions of CARM1 in

human cancer. CARM1 transactivates many cancer-associated

transcription factors including NF-kB, p53, E2F1, and steroid

receptors such as estrogen receptor alpha (ERa; Bedford and

Clarke, 2009), and promotes cancer cell proliferation (El Mes-

saoudi et al., 2006; Frietze et al., 2008). Recent tissue microarray

studies revealed that CARM1 expression is higher in metastatic

breast tumors than in normal breast tissues (Mann et al., 2013),

Cancer Cell

CARM1 Methylates BAF155 to Promote Tumorigenesis
PR, and HER2 (Davis et al., 2013). These results imply that

altered CARM1expression may underlie pathological conditions

and that, in breast cancer, CARM1 has roles beyond serving as a

coactivator for ERa. It remains to be determined whether the

oncogenic functions of CARM1 depend on its ability to regulate

cancer-driving transcription factors or to directly methylate can-

cer-relevant substrates, or both.

The significance of identifying cancer-relevant CARM1 sub-

strates is underscored by studies of the roles of histone H3

methylation in transcriptional activation of ER target genes (Wu

and Xu, 2012). Nonhistone substrates include p300/CBP,

AIB1/SRC-3, and RNA binding proteins such as PABP1, HuR,

HuD, and HnRNPs (Bedford and Clarke, 2009). Multiple lines of

evidence indicate that normal CARM1 expression is well above

that required for its essential roles. For instance, normal develop-

mental functions were maintained in genetically engineered

CARM1 hypomorphic mice with only 25% of the wild-type

(WT) CARM1 level (Kim et al., 2010). We recently showed that

knocking down 90% of endogenous CARM1 in MCF7 cells

only slightly reduces methylation of PABP1 (Zeng et al., 2013).

These results imply that even greatly depleted CARM1 catalytic

activity and substrate methylation are sufficient to maintain

major biological functions. Previously, CARM1 null mouse em-

bryonic fibroblast cell lysates were used as a hypomethylated

substrate source that led to identifying PABP1 as a CARM1 sub-

strate (Lee and Bedford, 2002). The CARM1 null cancer cell lines

would greatly facilitate identifying cancer-relevant substrates

and understanding of CARM1 oncogenic functions in breast

cancer cells. Herein, we generated CARM1 KO cancer cell lines

and used them to explore the roles of BAF155 methylation by

CARM1 in breast cancer models.

RESULTS

Generation of CARM1 KO Breast Cancer Cell Lines
Using ZFN Technology
We recently developed a sensitive methylated PABP1 (me-

PABP1) western blot method to monitor endogenous CARM1

levels and activity (Zeng et al., 2013). In contrast to the complete

loss of me-PABP1 in CARM1 null mouse embryonic fibroblasts

(CARM1�/� MEFs; Figure 1A, lanes 1 and 2), we found that
even though small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown

decreased CARM1 levels by 90%, the cellular me-PABP1 level

decreased by less than 20% (Figure 1A, lanes 3 and 4). Thus,

low levels of CARM1 are capable of substantial PABP1 methyl-

ation. Because CARM1 substrates therefore should remain

significantly methylated in CARM1 knockdown cells but be hy-

pomethylated in CARM1 null cells, we generated CARM1 null

cancer cell lines to identify cancer-relevant CARM1 substrates.

We utilized Zinc Finger Nuclease (ZFN) technology to create a

highly specific genomic scissors targeting exon 8 of CARM1

(Figure 1B), and through this generated a complete KO in cancer

cell lines. After transient transfection of ZFN plasmids into cells,

we performed limiting dilution to select single clones and

confirmed CARM1 KO by loss of me-PABP1 (Figure 1C) and

genomic DNA sequencing (Figure 1D). Representative KO

clones with complete depletion of me-PABP1 are shown in Fig-

ure 1C for MCF7, MDA-MB-231, and human embryonic kidney

293T (HEK293T) cell lines. The human CARM1 gene locus

resides at chromosome19 p13.2, a region triplicated in MCF7

and duplicated in MDA-MB-231 cells. The genomic DNA

sequencing analysis of two representative CARM1 KO clones

of MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 (Figure 1D) revealed misrepaired

DNA, resulting in mRNA degradation and gene deletion.

Although the efficiency of ZFN KO varied among cell lines

at 1.3%, 0.5%, and 3.6% for MCF7, MDA-MB-231, and

HEK293T, respectively, the average KO efficiency across all

clones analyzed was 1.2% (Figure 1E). When CARM1was re-ex-

pressed in two individual MCF7 CARM1 KO clones, me-PABP1

was restored (Figure 1F). Interestingly, we found that KO of

CARM1 in MCF7 cells inducedmorphology changes (Figure 1G),

whereas nomorphology changewas observed inMCF7 cells ex-

pressing CARM1 shRNA to knock down CARM1 to 10% of WT

levels (Figure 1G). The morphology change in the two KO clones

was rescued by re-expressingWTCARM1 (Figure 1G) but not an

enzyme-defective mutant (data not shown). We compared the

in vitro cell growth and in vivo tumor growth of MDA-MB-231

CARM1 KO and MCF7 CARM1 KO with their parental cells. KO

of CARM1 impeded cell growth and colony formation (Figures

S1A and S1B available online) and tumor growth in vivo (Fig-

ure S1C). These data strongly suggest that the cell morphology

change and growth defect in KO cells could be due to loss of

methylation of CARM1 substrates.

Identification of BAF155 as a Substrate for CARM1
The lack of understanding of the biological functions of CARM1

in cancers is at least partially attributed to the limited number of

known CARM1 substrates. A few CARM1 substrates were previ-

ously identified or validated by comparing CARM1+/+ and

CARM1�/� MEF cell lysates for in vitro and in vivo methylation
(Cheng et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2004). In contrast to CARM1-

expressing cells, where potential CARM1 substrates would be

blocked for further methylation, CARM1�/� MEF lysates served
as a hypomethylated substrate resource for CARM1 substrate

identification. Indeed, we found that MCF7 CARM1 KO cell

lysates were more strongly methylated in vitro by recombinant

CARM1 protein than CARM1�/� MEF cell lysates, as assayed
by 3H-CH3 labeling in an autoradiograph (Figure S2A) and west-

ern blotting using a newly developed asymmetrically dimethy-

lated arginine (a-ADMA) antibody (Dhar et al., 2013; Figure S2B).

This result implies that MCF7 CARM1 KO cells serve as a good

resource for substrate discovery.

When cell lysates derived from parental MCF7 cells and

CARM1 KO cells were probed with monomethylated arginine

(a-MMA) and a-ADMA antibodies in western blots, asymmetri-

cally dimethylated proteins, in particular those in the high mo-

lecular weight range, were significantly affected by CARM1

KO (Figure 2A). This is in contrast to the lack of a significant
RM1 KO clones, and MCF7 CARM1 KO clones re-expressing CARM1 by

s, and the MCF7-derived CARM1 KO cell lines listed in (F). Scale bar = 40 mm.

mass spectrometry, from which ten candidate proteins were

identified (Figure 2B). To discern whether these proteins are

CARM1 substrates, we immunoprecipitated endogenous pro-

teins (BRG1, BAF170, BAF155, and BAF250) or FLAG-tagged

proteins (TRAP150, Caprin 1, TRAP230, and BCLAF1) tran-

siently transfected to MCF7 WT or KO cells, and followed

their fate in western blots using a-ADMA or a-FLAG antibody,

respectively.

Western blot results using a-ADMA antibody (Figure 2C)

classified the candidate proteins into three categories. The first

category includes BAF155 and TRAP230 proteins, which are

dimethylated in WT but not in KO MCF7 cells, indicating that

arginine dimethylation of these proteins is CARM1 dependent.

The second category includes Caprin1 and BCLAF1 proteins,

which are dimethylated in WT and KO cells at similar levels,

indicating that CARM1 is not their sole methyltransferase.

Finally, the third category includes BAF170, BRG1, BAF250,

and TRAP150 proteins, which are not recognized by a-ADMA

antibody, suggesting that they were immunoprecipitated by

the a-ADMA antibody via indirect association with bone fide

CARM1 substrates (e.g., BRG1, BAF250, and BAF170 are in

complex with methylated BAF155). Although the a-ADMA anti-

body recently developed by Cell Signaling appeared sensitive

in detecting CARM1 substrates, this antibody has not been

extensively characterized (Dhar et al., 2013).

Since a previous study had reported that a histone H3 argi-

nine17 dimethylation (H3R17me2) antibody, while recognizing

the H3R17me2 mark, also recognized other CARM1 substrates

in MEF cells (Cheng et al., 2007), we employed this anti-

H3R17me2 antibody for western blotting (Figure S2C, left panel)

and immunoprecipitation, followed by Coomassie blue staining

(Figure S2C, right panel), using total cell lysates from MCF7

WT and KO cells. Similar to the pattern detected by a-ADMA

antibody, the recognized proteins specific to CARM1 WT but

not CARM1 KO cells reside in the high molecular weight range,

among which BAF155 was identified using mass spectrometry

(Figure S2C). Correspondingly, one strong band (Figure S2D,

arrow head) migrating between 130 and 250 kDa was detected

by a-ADMA antibody in the a-H3R17me2 immunoprecipitates

from WT but not KO MCF7 cell lysates. This band was subse-

quently proved to be BAF155 by reciprocal immunoprecipitation

using H3R17me2 and BAF155 antibodies (Figures S2E and S2F).

Collectively, BAF155 appeared to be amain substrate of CARM1

in MCF7 cells detected by both a-ADMA and H3R17me2

antibodies.

To address whether BAF155 ismethylated by CARM1 directly,

we performed in vitro methylation assays using recombinant

CARM1 and hypomethylated BAF155 purified from HEK293T

CARM1 KO cells in the presence of adenosyl-L-methionine,

S-[methyl-3H] (3H-SAM). As expected, BAF155 was methylated

by CARM1 in vitro (Figure 2D). Finally, we demonstrated that

BAF155 methylation could be restored in HEK293T CARM1

KO cells by expressing WT CARM1 but not a methylation-

defective mutant (Figure 2E). These results collectively

demonstrate that CARM1 is both necessary and sufficient to

methylate BAF155. In keeping with this finding, CARM1 was

found to be the only PRMT among PRMT family members

(PRMT1–PRMT8) that is capable of methylating BAF155

in vitro (Figure S2G).
CARM1 Methylates BAF155 at a Single Site, R1064
Although multiple CARM1 substrates were discovered using the

a-ADMA antibody and CARM1 KO cell line (Figure 2B), we chose

to focus on BAF155 because BAF155, a core subunit of switch/

sucrose nonfermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling com-

plex, has been reported upregulated in colon, cervical, and pros-

tate cancer (Lapointe et al., 2004; Tomlins et al., 2007; Varambally

et al., 2005). Using PMeS (Shi et al., 2012), an online tool for pre-

dicting protein methylation sites based on an enhanced feature-

encoding scheme, five putative arginine methylation sites were

predicted on human BAF155 (Table S1). Based on the putative

methylation sites, a full-length and four C-terminally truncated

BAF155 derivatives with C-terminal myc tags were constructed

(Figure 3A). These plasmids were transiently transfected into

HEK293T cells, and the resulting proteins were immunopreci-

pated using a-myc antibody and western blotted with a-ADMA

antibody (Figure 3B). Notably, full-length BAF155 but none

of the truncated BAF155 proteins was detected by a-ADMA

antibody, suggesting that the BAF155 methylation site follows

residue 956. We then individually mutated C-proximal R1032

and R1064 to lysine in FLAG-tagged expression plasmids.

After transient expression and anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation,

FLAG-BAF155R1032K but not FLAG-BAF155R1064K protein was

detected by a-ADMA antibody in vivo (Figure 3C). Similarly, the

recombinant BAF155R1064K mutant protein was not methylated

by recombinant CARM1 in vitro (Figure 3D). Thus, R1064 is the

only BAF155 site methylated by CARM1.

Antibodies against endogenous CARM1 or BAF155 each

immunoprecipitated both proteins from MCF7 cell lysates

(Figure 3E), suggesting that CARM1 and BAF155 may directly

interact. To map the BAF155 region mediating association with

CARM1, we linked each of a series of BAF155 truncation deriv-

atives (Chen and Archer, 2005) with a T7 promoter and FLAG

tag (Figure 3F) for in vitro transcription/translation assays. As

shown in Figure 3F, full-length BAF155 and its C-terminally trun-

cated (D1, D2, D3 and D4) but not N-terminally truncated (D5, D6

and D7) derivatives bound strongly to bacterially expressed

glutathione S-transferase CARM1 (GST-CARM1). Thus, the

acidic domain at the BAF155 N terminus mediates interaction

with CARM1, although R1064, the site of methylation, localizes

to the BAF155 C terminus. R1064 of human BAF155, located

in the evolutionarily conserved proline- and glutamine-rich (P/

Q-rich) domain, is conserved among higher eukaryotes (Fig-

ure 3G). BAF170, while sharing 61.7% protein sequence identity

with BAF155, lacks an arginine residue at a position equivalent

to R1064 in its corresponding P/Q-rich domain (Figure 3H).

This explains why BAF170, a close homolog of BAF155, is not

a substrate for CARM1 (Figure 2C).

The Majority of Endogenous BAF155 in MCF7 Cells Is
Dimethylated
To investigate the prevalence of endogenous BAF155 dimethy-

lation in breast cancer cells, we generated a rabbit polyclonal

antibody specific for dimethylated BAF155 (Figure S3A). This

me-BAF155 antibody detects methylation of endogenous

BAF155 in WT MCF7 cells but not in two MCF7 CARM1 KO

clones (Figure S3B). Similar to PABP1 (Figure 1A), me-BAF155

was still detectable in MCF7-shCARM1 cells (Figure S3C). To

determine the percentage of endogenous BAF155 methylated

Cancer Cell

CARM1 Methylates BAF155 to Promote Tumorigenesis
by CARM1 in breast cancer cells, we immunoprecipitated

BAF155 using theme-BAF155 antibody and performed quantita-

tive western blotting of equal portions of the input and flow-

through fractions using the total BAF155 antibody (Figure S3D).

Quantitation of the band intensities across three independent ex-

periments revealed that �74% of endogenous BAF155 was
methylated by CARM1 in MCF7 cells. Moreover, BAF155 and

me-BAF155 immunofluorescence were confined to the nucleus

(Figure S3E). Since the majority of endogenous BAF155 is dime-

thylated, we went on to study the role of BAF155 methylation in

human breast cancer cells.

BAF155 Methylation at R1064 Creates Unique
Chromatin Association Patterns
BAF155, a core component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodel-

ing complex, was shown to associate with chromatin depen-

dently or independently of other SWI/SNF subunits using

chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) in HeLa

cells (Euskirchen et al., 2011). Accordingly, we decided to deter-

mine the effect of BAF155 methylation on its chromatin associa-

tion. First, to substitute endogenous BAF155 with BAF155R1064K

mutant, we infected MCF7 cells with retrovirus vectors express-

ing either WT BAF155 (BAF155WT), mutant BAF155R1064K, or

GFP as a negative control (Figure 4A). After confirming that

the resulting total BAF155 level was twice the endogenous

BAF155 level, we stably knocked down endogenous BAF155 us-

ing a lentiviral-expressing shRNA, which selectively targets the

30UTR of the endogenous, but not the lentiviral-expressed,
BAF155 mRNA. Figure 4A shows that BAF155 was silenced

in MCF7-GFP cells, and that MCF7-BAF155WT and MCF7-

BAF155R1064K cells express reconstituted BAF155WT and

BAF155R1064K proteins to levels similar to that of endogenous

BAF155 protein in the parental MCF7 cells. Interestingly,

substituting endogenous BAF155 with BAF155R1064K, like

BAF155 knockdown, significantly reduced colony size (Fig-

ure 4B, lower panels) and yield (Figure 4C), while cell morphology

was not changed (Figure 4B, upper panels). To investigate

whether BAF155 methylation by CARM1 is required for

CARM1-induced colony formation in MCF7 cells, we first stably

overexpressed BAF155WT and BAF155R1064 in MCF7 CARM1

KO cells, respectively, followed by knocking down the endo-

genous BAF155 in these cells using lentivirus-expressing

shBAF155. Subsequently CARM1 was restored in MCF7

CARM1 KO cells expressing either BAF155WT or BAF155R1064,

and colony formation assays were performed. The expected

levels of total BAF155, me-BAF155, and CARM1 proteins were

confirmed by western blotting (Figure 4D). Restoring CARM1 in

BAF155WT-expressing but not BAF155R1064K-expressing cells

rescued colony formation in terms of both colony size and yield

(Figures 4E and 4F). These results further support that BAF155

methylation affects the cellular functions of BAF155.

To ensure that BAF155 methylation does not affect its assem-

bly into the SWI/SNF complex, we expressed BAF155WT and

BAF155R1064K in SKOV3, an ovarian cancer cell line that ex-

presses all SWI/SNF components except BAF155 (DelBove

et al., 2011). As shown in Figure S4, immunoprecipitating

either BAF155WT or BAF155R1064K effectively pulled down other

SWI/SNF components such as BRG1, BAF60a, and BAF47

in SKOV3 cells. Only BAF155WT, but not BAF155R1064K, was

methylated by endogenous CARM1, as revealed by a-ADMA

immunoblot (Figure S4A). Thus, both CARM1-methylated

and -unmethylated BAF155 assemble into SWI/SNF complexes.

Next we determinedwhethermethylation of BAF155 affects its

chromatin association, using a genomic ChIP-seq approachwith

MCF7-BAF155WT and MCF7-BAF155R1064K cells. A ChIP-grade

BAF155 antibody (Euskirchen et al., 2011) was used for ChIP fol-

lowed by Illumina high-throughput sequencing. Representative

BAF155WT, BAF155R1064K, and BRG1 binding sites in HeLa

and MCF7 cells in a 7.5 Mb region of chromosome 8 are shown

in Figure 4G. As expected, while some BAF155WT peaks identi-

fied in MCF7 cells overlap with the binding sites of BAF155 and

BRG1 in HeLa cells (Figure 4G, box a; Euskirchen et al., 2011),

BAF155WT also has unique binding sites in MCF7 and HeLa cells

(Figure 4G, box d). We subsequently analyzed the genome-wide

distribution of BAF155 binding peaks in MCF7 expressing WT or

mutant BAF155. Totals of 2,667 and 1,566 peaks were identified

for BAF155WT or BAF155R1064K, respectively. Among these, 983

peaks overlapped (Table S2). The numbers of annotated genes

in the genomic regions associated with these BAF155WT and

BAF155R1064K binding sites are shown in Figure 4H. As in HeLa

cells, approximately 60% of BAF155 binding sites in MCF7 cells

reside in gene bodies (exons and introns; Figure 4I). Moreover,

BAF155 peaks in MCF7 cells are enriched within +50 kb from

the transcription starting sites (TSSs), which are likely to contain

enhancer regions (Figure 4J). This pattern is consistent with

The Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool (GREAT)

identified meiosis and c-Myc pathways as the two leading path-

ways uniquely associated with BAF155WT but not BAF155R1064K

(Figure 4K), implying that BAF155 methylation might direct its

association with genes involved in potentially cancer-relevant

c-Myc pathways.

BAF155 Methylation Controls Expression of Genes in
the c-Myc Pathway
In contrast to the promoter regions of CDH1 and TFF1 genes

where both BAF155WT and BAF155R1064K bind similarly (Fig-

ure S5A), many c-Myc pathway genes were selectively enriched

for BAF155WT but not BAF155R1064K, as shown in Figure S5B for

CDCA7, COL1A2, GADD45A, DDX18, and NDRG1 in HeLa and

MCF7 cells. Next we performed conventional ChIP using distinct

sets of biological samples to validate whether BAF155 is associ-

ated with the binding sites determined in the ChIP-seq experi-

ment. As shown in Figure 5A, BAF155WT but not BAF155R1064K

was found associated with the ChIP-seq-implicated regions

of CDCA7, COL1A2, GADD45A, DDX18, and NDRG1, whereas

both BAF155 forms were detected at the promoter region of

CDH1. ChIP using the me-BAF155 antibody confirmed the

association of me-BAF155 to COL1A2 and GADD45A genes

in MCF7-BAF155WT but not in MCF7-BAF155R1064K cells (Fig-

ure 5B). Importantly, BAF155 association strongly correlated

with gene expression. COL1A2 and GADD45A mRNA levels,

for example, were higher in MCF7-BAF155WT than in MCF7-

BAF155R1064 or MCF7-GFP with endogenous BAF155 silenced

(Figure 5C). To examine whether the association of BAF155

withCOL1A2 andGADD45A genes depends on CARM1 expres-

sion, we performed ChIP assays in parental MCF7 and CARM1

KO cells. As shown in Figures 5D and 5F, CARM1 KO resulted

in significant decreases of BAF155 association with the impli-

cated regions of COL1A2 and GADD45A. Thus, CARM1 is an

important determinant for BAF155 genomic association, and

CARM1-mediated BAF155 methylation could induce BAF155

association with unique genomic sites to control gene regulation.

Interestingly, we could not detect binding above background

of CARM1, BAF53, or SWI/SNF adenosine triphosphatase

(ATPase) subunits BRG1 and BRM at the same regions of the

COL1A2 and GADD45A genes where BAF155 binds (Figures

5E and 5G), although BRG1 could be detected at positive control

Quantitative data are presented as averages ± SD. Student’s t test was used for
regions (e.g., the CDH1 and TFF1 promoters; Figures S5C and

S5D). The positive binding of other SWI/SNF subunits SNF5,

BAF53, and BRM to CDH1 and TFF1 genes similarly validated

the corresponding antibodies for ChIP (Figure S5C). Despite

the lack of detectable binding of BRG1 to COL1A2, GADD45A,

and NDRG1 regions (Figure S5D), SNF5 but not BAF53 was

found at the BAF155-binding sites (Figures 5E, 5G, and S5D)

of the corresponding genes. Accordingly, methylated BAF155

might be in a subcomplex with other BAFs such as SNF5 at

unique chromatin sites.

BAF155 Methylation Correlates with Human Breast
Cancer Progression and Malignancy
To determine whether me-BAF155 could serve as a prognostic

biomarker for human breast cancer, we first optimized the

me-BAF155 peptide antibody for immunohistochemistry (IHC).

IHC staining of me-BAF155 could be completely blocked by

me-BAF155 peptide but not by nonmethylated BAF155 peptide

(Figure S6A), showing that the me-BAF155 antibody is specific.

We next performed IHC using total BAF155 antibody as well

as me-BAF155 antibody with four pairs of matched breast

normal and tumor samples. As shown in Figure S6B, me-

BAF155 staining was almost undetectable in normal samples,

while both total BAF155 protein level and me-BAF155 intensity

were elevated in breast tumors. Notably, CARM1 protein levels

also were elevated in tumors relative to matched normal tissues

(Figure S6C).

These results suggest that the increased level of me-

BAF155 in tumors reflects overall elevated levels of BAF155

and CARM1. Thus, the me-BAF155 level might be a sensitive

breast cancer progression biomarker. To test this hypothesis,

we employed commercial tissuemicroarrays (TMAs), which con-

tained�80 samples from normal tissues, tumor-adjacent normal
(TAN), benign tumors, malignant tumors, and metastatic tumors

excised prior to treatment. Modest me-BAF155 staining was

seen with normal (Figure 6A), TAN, and benign tissues (Fig-

ure 6B). In contrast, significantly greater me-BAF155 IHC

staining was observed with malignant and metastatic tumors.

One hundred percent of metastatic tumors (6/6) showed strong

positive staining for me-BAF155 (Figures 6C and 6D). To investi-

gate if BAF155 methylation status is associated with clinical

outcomes, we employed TMAs containing 372 breast tumor

specimens with 150 months of clinical follow-up. TMAs

were immunostained with me-BAF155-specific antibody, and

CARM1 Methylates BAF155 to Promote Tumorigenesis
specimens were rank ordered by immunostaining intensity

and divided into me-BAF155-negative (bottom 25% intensity)

and -positive (top 75% intensity) groups. The Kaplan-Meier

plot shows that the me-BAF155-negative patients have a higher

recurrence-free survival rate than do me-BAF155-positive

patients (Figure 6E). A log-rank test performed to formally test

this difference in recurrence-free survival rates yielded a statisti-

cally significant p value of 0.0497. Notably, the results of the

multivariate analyses performed using the Cox proportional

hazards model indicate a recurrence hazard 1.789 times higher

for patients with me-BAF155-positive tumors when compared

with me-BAF155-negative tumors (p = 0.034; Figures 6F and

6G). This hazard ratio of 1.789 for me-BAF155-positive tumors

is similar to that of triple-negative breast cancer (hazard ratio =

1.845), a category well known for its poor prognosis. This differ-

ence in recurrence hazard rates is shown in the cumulative

hazard plot (Figure 6F). These data underscored the potential

use of me-BAF155 as a biomarker of malignant breast cancer

and also in prognostic stratification of breast cancer patients.

Methylation of BAF155 Promotes Migration and
Metastasis of Breast Cancer Cells In Vitro and In Vivo
To investigate of the role of BAF155 methylation in tumor migra-

tion and metastasis, we employed MDA-MB-231, an aggressive

breast cancer cell line model, for in vitro transwell migration and

in vivo metastasis studies. Using a strategy similar to that for

MCF7 cells (Figure 4A), we engineered stable cell line MDA-

MB-231-GFP with endogenous BAF155 knockdown, and its

reconstituted derivatives MDA-MB-231-BAF155WT and MDA-

MB-231-BAF155R1064K (Figure 7A). Knockdown of endogenous

BAF155 in MDA-MB-231 cells significantly decreased cell

growth (Figure 7B, compare - with ,), which was rescued by

restoring BAF155WT but not BAF155R1064K (Figure 7B, compare

: with 6). Furthermore, knockdown of endogenous BAF155

in MDA-MB-231 cells significantly decreased cell migration in

transwell assay, an effect that was partially rescued by restoring

BAF155WT but not BAF155R1064K (Figure 7C). To explore the

possibility that methylation of BAF155 is required for establishing

metastatic lung colonization in vivo, we injected MDA-MB-

231-BAF155WT and MDA-MB-231-BAF155R1064K cells stably

expressing firefly luciferase intravenously to nude mice and

monitored tumor cell colonization and outgrowth in lung using

bioluminescence imaging. On the day of injection (day 0), both

Quantitative data are presented as averages ± SD. Student’s t test was used for
mulated in the lung as expected (Minn et al., 2005). Time-

course analysis of the two cohorts revealed significant

differences in lung colonization. BAF155WT-expressing but not

BAF155R1064K-expressing cells showed colonization and tumor

outgrowth in lung (Figure 7D). Thus, BAF155 methylation is posi-

tively linked to lung metastasis.

To gain further insight into the mechanism by which

BAF155 methylation regulates MDA-MB-231 metastasis,

we employed the tumor metastasis RT2 profiler PCR array

(SABiosciences), containing 84 genes involved in metastasis, to

compare the mRNA expression profiles between MDA-MB-

231-BAF155R1064K and MDA-MB-231-BAF155WT (Figure 7E). If

more than 2-fold expression difference was seen between

the two cell lines, the corresponding genes are marked green

or red (Figure 7E) and are listed in Figure 7F. Two metastasis

repressor genes, CDH11 and KISS1R, were upregulated,

and six metastasis-promoting genes, CCL7, CDH6, COL4A2,

CXCL12, MMP13, and MYCL1, were downregulated in MDA-

MB-231-BAF155R1064K cells compared with BAF155WT cells.

Four genes were selected for validation using real-time PCR.

Indeed, KISS1R and CDH11 were expressed at higher levels in

MDA-MB-231-BAF155R1064K cells, whereas CCL7 and COL4A2

were expressed at higher levels in MDA-MB-231-BAF155WT

cells (Figure 7G). We further systematically compared the

differential gene expression of MDA-MB-231-BAF155WT

and -BAF155R1064K using Affymetrix microarrays. Over 700

genes were differentially expressed in two cell lines (p < 0.05);

322 and 411 genes were upregulated and downregulated,

respectively (Figure S7A). Among other differential expressed

genes identified (Table S3), the metastasis genes COL4A2

and TIMP3 (Figure 7F) and c-MYC pathway gene CDCA7 (Fig-

ure 5C) were expressed at higher levels in BAF155WT cells than

inBAF155R1064K cells. Geneontology pathway analyses revealed

that themajor differentially expressed genes fall in the categories

of cellular movement, cellular organization, cell proliferation,

and migration (Figure S7B). Moreover, despite the different cell

lines used to study gene expression andDNAbinding differences

between WT BAF155 and BAF155R1064K, one-fourth of the

differentially expressed genes identified by microarrays in

MDA-MB-231 cells overlap with differentially bound genomic

regions identified by ChIP-seq in MCF7 cells (Figure S7C). These

results suggest that BAF155 methylation regulates important

pathways involved in cancer progression, including cell move-

ment and migration.

Cancer Cell

CARM1 Methylates BAF155 to Promote Tumorigenesis

32 Cancer Cell 25, 21–36, January 13, 2014 ª2014 Elsevier Inc.



Cancer Cell

CARM1 Methylates BAF155 to Promote Tumorigenesis
DISCUSSION

One important finding above is that knocking down endogenous

CARM1 by 90% is insufficient to mimic the biological effects of

complete CARM1 KO. This echoes the in vivo mouse model

where reducing CARM1 to 25% of endogenous level still sus-

tains normal development (Kim et al., 2010). Consistent with

this, CARM1 KO decreased cell and tumor growth in vitro and

in vivo, in contrast to little in vivo growth effect of CARM1

shRNA-mediated knockdown in MCF7 (Al-Dhaheri et al., 2011).

While CARM1 knockdown may selectively affect methylation of

some substrates but not others, our findings underscore the

importance of using complete KOs when studying the biological

functions of enzymes.

Although engineered ZFNs have been used for genome editing

in diverse model organisms, allele engineering in somatic cell

genetics has not been widely applied for determining enzyme

functions. KO efficiency by ZFNs varies among cancer cell lines

and depends on transfection efficiency and the multiplicity of the

targeted chromosome. For example, the CARM1 disruption fre-

quency reached 10% of alleles in diploid breast cancer cell line

CAL51 (data not shown), compared with 1.3% in MCF7 cells

where CARM1-bearing chromosome 19 is triplicated. In fact,

one-time transient transfection of a plasmid encoding the

CARM1 ZFN in MCF7 cells only disrupted CARM1 biallelically,

as confirmed by sequencing of genomic DNA. In agreement

with a report that sequential ZFN transfection of biallelically dis-

rupted clones resulted in triple locus KO at frequency of 1% (Liu

et al., 2010), limiting dilution and genotyping without antibiotic

selection yielded two MCF7 clones (out of 159) in which

CARM1 was disrupted triallelically (Figure 1E). Despite low KO

frequency in some cases, ZFN-mediated KO of genes like

CARM1 in cancer cell lines provides unprecedented opportu-

nities for cancer-relevant substrate discovery since, for example,

MEFs lack or express many CARM1 substrates at lower level

than CARM1 null cancer cell lines. Identifying cancer-relevant

substrates for CARM1 is essential for elucidating its functions

in cancer, as exemplified by BAF155.

SWI/SNF is a multisubunit chromatin-remodeling complex

that has been strongly implicated in cancer development due

to aberrant expression and mutation of its subunits in many

tumor types (Weissman and Knudsen, 2009). Accompanying

the SWI/SNF ATPase subunits (e.g., BRG1) are 9–12 BAF

proteins, including core and accessory subunits. The core

subunits, BAF155, BAF170, and SNF5 (also referred to as

SMARCB1, BAF47, or SNF5/INI1), were defined on the basis

of their ability to restore efficient nucleosome remodeling

in vitro (Phelan et al., 1999). Recent whole genome sequencing

of human tumors revealed that SWI/SNF subunits are mutated

in >20% of human malignancies (Kadoch et al., 2013). For

example, SNF5 behaves as a bona fide tumor suppressor

gene (Roberts et al., 2002). Conflicting evidence suggests

that BAF155 may serve as tumor suppressor or oncogene

in a tumor-type-specific manner. BAF155 was initially impli-

cated as a tumor suppressor because of its residency in chro-

mosome 3p21.31, a region frequently deleted in lung and

other adenocarcinomas (Zabarovsky et al., 2002). Coincidently,

BAF155 expression is deficient in two ovarian cancer cell

lines, SKOV3 and SNUC2B (DelBove et al., 2011). However,

mounting evidence supports that, for at least some tumor

types, BAF155 might enhance tumor development. BAF155

expression is markedly induced in prostate cancer (Lapointe

et al., 2004), cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (Shadeo et al.,

2008), and colon cancer (Andersen et al., 2009). Elevated

BAF155 expression was correlated with poor prognosis and

recurrence in colon cancer (Andersen et al., 2009). The varied

BAF155 expression in distinct tumor types suggests that aber-

rant BAF155 levels may contribute to tumor initiation and pro-

gression in a context-dependent manner.

We report here that BAF155 is elevated in human breast

tumors and that increased methylation of BAF155 is associated

with poor survival, implicating BAF155 as an independent prog-

nosis biomarker. Individual ChIP experiments showed that some

genomic sites seem to bind BAF155 independently of BRG1.

Further ChIP-seq to improve signal/noise ratios and mapping

of genomic sites using anti-me-BAF155 and BRG1 antibodies

will more fully test BRG1-independent binding of BAF155 to

chromatin sites. Nonetheless, our results support that methyl-

ated BAF155 might have functions independent from the full

SWI/SNF complex, which agrees with earlier reports that individ-

ual SWI/SNF subunits confer oncogenic functions independently

of the entire complex (Park et al., 2002). For example, BAF53

formed a distinct complex with c-Myc cofactors, including

histone acetyltransferases to enhance c-Myc’s oncogenic trans-

formation activity (Park et al., 2002). It remains unknown whether

me-BAF155 and SNF5 form complexes distinct fromSWI/SNF at

genomic loci specific for me-BAF155, including c-Myc pathway

gene loci.

The c-Myc pathway deregulation is a common feature of

human tumorigenesis. The Myc oncoprotein provides selective

advantages to cancer cells by promoting proliferation, cell sur-

vival, genetic instability, and differentiation blockage, which

all contribute to metastasis. This study reveals that methylated

BAF155 is specifically recruited to c-Myc pathway genes,

some of which are direct c-Myc targets (e.g., GADD45A) and

some of which are not (e.g., COL1A2). COL1A2 produces a

component of type I collagen, the pro-a2 (I) chain, involved in in-

flammatory response pathways. COL1A2 was among a ‘‘meta-

signature’’ associated with breast cancer prognosis (Urquidi

and Goodison, 2007). GADD45A (DNA damage-inducible

transcript 1 protein) functions as a stress sensor that modulates

cellular responses to various stress conditions, including geno-

toxic and oncogenic stresses. Depending on the oncogenic

stress, GADD45A could function as promoter or suppressor for

breast cancer (Tront et al., 2010). GADD45A promotes tumor

vascularization and growth of Myc-driven breast cancer via

negative regulation of MMP10 (Tront et al., 2010).

Recently, ‘‘poor prognosis’’ gene expression signatures in

cancer, particularly in breast cancer, were found to reflect the

activity of the c-Myc oncoprotein, which in turn regulates tumor

metastasis through regulation of metastasis-relevant target

genes and/or globally altering the epigenomic landscape of

cancer cells (Wolfer et al., 2010). BAF155 methylation affects

expression of a number of genes involved in metastasis. Inter-

estingly, another study using the MDA-MB-231 cell line model

showed that c-Myc knockdown had modest effects on primary

tumor growth, whereas metastatic behavior and distant lung

metastasis were greatly inhibited (Wolfer et al., 2010). This

study suggests that c-Myc is essential for maintaining an inva-

sive and migratory state of the highly metastatic MDA-MB-231

cells. Future studies will determine whether BAF155-methyl-

ation-sensitive metastatic genes are directly regulated by

c-Myc. Given that 10%–15% of genomic loci in mammals are

bound by c-Myc (Zeller et al., 2006), it is plausible that c-Myc

affects metastasis-relevant gene expression via direct tran-

scriptional regulation mechanism or via global alteration of

chromatin structure of cancer cells, thus promoting the meta-

static phenotype.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Generation of CARM1 KO Cells

Cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding the indicated ZFN

pairs using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for 72 hr. Single-cell clones were

isolated by limiting dilution of the ZFN-treated pool. The whole cell lysate of

each clone was collected and CARM1 levels were detected by western blot.

To analyze genomic DNA sequences of each positive clone, the target

locus was first amplified by PCR using primers CARM1-ZFN-sense: 50-
ACAGCCTGCCTTCTCAGG-30, anti-sense: 50-TGCACAGCAATGGCAAGT-30.
Then the PCR product was cloned into pCR4-TOPO vector. For each cell

line, plasmid DNAs from 50 bacterial colonies were sequenced.

Animal Models

All animal work was performed in accordance with protocols approved by

Research Animal Resource Center of University of Wisconsin-Madison. Athy-

mic nude mice at 5–6 weeks old were used for xenograft experiments (Harlan).

Information for the animal experiments is presented in the Supplemental

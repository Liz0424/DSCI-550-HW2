Abstract

Superoxide dismutases’ (SODs) expression is altered in several diseases including Alzheimer, atherosclerosis, cancer and
psoriasis. Previously, we reported a marked increase in Mn-SOD and Cu,Zn-SOD functional activity in human dermal psoriatic
fibroblasts. As retinoic acid (RA) has been used in the treatment of psoriasis and a mechanism for its beneficial effects is not

understood, we investigated the effects of RA on SOD mRNA and protein expression levels in human normal and psoriatic
fibroblasts. Prior to RA exposure, Cu,Zn-SOD protein and mRNA levels were similar in normal compared to psoriatic fibroblasts
while Mn-SOD protein and mRNA levels were increased in psoriatic cells. However, in contrast to normal fibroblasts, exposure of

psoriatic fibroblasts to 1 mM RA down-regulated Mn-SOD mRNA, and also decreased Mn-SOD activity by w80% with no change
in Mn-SOD protein levels. In contrast, Cu,Zn-SOD protein and enzymatic activity were modestly reduced by RA treatment in both
normal and psoriatic fibroblasts. Furthermore, RA treatment of psoriatic fibroblasts also caused a decrease in Cu,Zn-SOD steady-

state mRNA levels. These results indicate that RA can serve as a regulatory agent to down-regulate the steady-state levels of both
Mn-SOD and Cu,Zn-SOD in psoriatic cells. These findings offer a new model for the antiinflammatory activity of RA when used in
the treatment of psoriasis.

1. Introduction

Studies to define the role of superoxide radicals (O2
c�)

in both physiological and pathological processes are an
area of active investigation. Reactive oxygen species
(ROS), including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), superoxide
radicals and hydroxyl radicals are generated in cells in
response to stimulation by various hormones, growth
factors and cytokines [1], such as PDGF [2,3]. The

oxygen radicals generated appear to act as second
messengers in transmembrane signaling pathways and
modulate cellular functions such as cell proliferation,
differentiation, and apoptosis [3]. Oxidative regulation
of several key enzymes involved in cellular signal
transduction, including protein kinases, has been de-
scribed [4].

Oxidants also have been implicated in a number of
pathological disorders, including Alzheimer disease,
psoriasis, aging, atherosclerosis, and cancer [5e8]. The
primary cellular defenses against damage that can be
caused by O2

c� and by its reactive progeny are the
superoxide dismutases (SODs). Mammalian cells have
a mitochondrial Mn-SOD, a cytoplasmic Cu,Zn-SOD
(also found in peroxysomes) and an extracellular SOD
which is a Cu,Zn-SOD that is immunologically distinct
from the classical Cu,Zn-SOD [9]. These metalloen-
zymes act to dismute toxic superoxide radicals to oxygen
and H2O2[9e11]. Catalase, along with peroxidases such
as glutathione peroxide, in turn catalyze the decompo-
sition of H2O2 to water and oxygen. Studies have been
ongoing for a number of years in our laboratories on the
synergism between retinoic acid and cyclic AMP that
regulates cell growth and differentiation [12]. In the
course of these studies, it was established that cyclic
AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity, as well
as 8-azido-[

32
P] cAMP binding to the RI and RII

regulatory subunits, are decreased in cells of psoriatic
patients compared to cells of normal subjects [13]. More
recent studies determined that exposure of normal
human dermal fibroblasts to H2O2 and to other oxygen
free radical generating systems decreased both PKA
activity and cyclic AMP binding to RI and RII, to levels
similar to those observed with psoriatic fibroblasts [14].
Treatment of psoriatic fibroblasts with free radical
scavenging agents restored the ability of RI and RII to
bind cyclic AMP toward normal levels. We also showed
that SOD activity, particularly that of the mitochondrial
enzyme, Mn-SOD, was elevated in fibroblasts prepared
from a psoriatic patient [15]. These results suggested
that oxidative modification may serve as a mechanism to
alter PKA in human cells, and that an altered oxidative
state may be responsible for the decrease in PKA
activity and cyclic AMP binding in cells from psoriatic
patients.

Retinoic acid derivatives have been used with some
success in the therapeutic treatment of psoriasis even
though the mechanism of retinoid action responsible for
this beneficial effect was not known [16,17]. Previously,
we established that the treatment of psoriatic fibroblasts
with retinoic acid and with other retinoids, such as 13-
cis-retinoic acid and arotinoid induced an increase in the
oxidatively modified PKA activity back towards normal
levels [13]. Again however, the mechanism by which
retinoic acid acted to increase PKA activity in psoriatic
cells remained to be elucidated. Thus, the present studies
were carried out to determine if retinoic acid treatment
might differentially regulate antioxidant enzyme activi-
ties in normal and psoriatic fibroblasts. To address this
question Mn-SOD and Cu,Zn-SOD functional activi-
ties, as well as Mn-SOD and Cu,Zn-SOD mRNA levels
and protein levels, were determined in cells in the
presence and absence of retinoic acid. Retinoid treat-
ment of psoriatic fibroblasts was observed to signifi-
cantly decrease both Mn-SOD activity and steady-state
mRNA levels as well as both Cu,Zn-SOD expression
and enzymatic activity.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Experimental reagents

Retinoic acid (RA) and actinomycin D (ActD) were
obtained from Sigma (Saint Louis, MI, USA) and
cycloheximide was purchased from Calbiochem (La
Jolla, CA, USA). ActD was dissolved in dimethylsulf-
oxide (Me2SO). RA was dissolved in 100% ethanol and
cycloheximide in double distilled water (ddH2O).
DMEM with L-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, fetal
bovine serum and antibiotics were obtained from
Invitrogen. The antibody to b-actin was an anti-mouse
monoclonal antibody purchased from Sigma. The rabbit
anti-human Mn-SOD antibody and the goat anti-
human Cu,Zn-SOD antibody were gifts of Dr
N. Taniguchi, Osaka, Japan. The horseradish peroxi-
dase-labelled secondary antibody was obtained from
Jackson Immunoresearch. Protein assay reagents and
polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were purchased
from Bio-Rad (Marnes la Coquette, France).

2.2. Cells

Human fibroblasts were isolated from seven normal
and seven untreated adult psoriatic patients (Psoriasis
vulgaris in flare for approximately 3 months) by
enzymatic digestion of small pieces (4 mm) of lesional
and non-lesional buttock and abdominal skin punch
biopsies as previously described [14,18]. These Caucasian
subjects were age- and sex-matched. This study was
approved by the ethical committee of the Hôpital Cochin
(Paris). The patients had received no systemic therapy
such as corticosteroids, antimitotic drugs, retinoids for
at least a year before the study; no systemic anti-
inflammatory drugs for at least two weeks before the
biopsy; no local corticosteroids, ultraviolet light, or oral
psoralen for at least three months before the assay. The
severity of the disease was determined by mean psoriatic
area and severity index (PASI)score, as described by
Frederiksson and Peterssonn [45]. The PASI score for
the 10 patients were 22.54G0.47 (Range 12.8e34.1).
Cells were grown as previously described [14] and used



71P. Gerbaud et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 24 (2005) 69e78
subconfluent (10
6
cells/dish) at the fifth passage. All data

were obtained with cells propagated for the same number
of passages (fifth passage) under identical culture
conditions. For each donor the different assays were
performed on the same cell extracts prepared from cells
arising from the same cell seeding.

2.3. Preparation of cellular fractions

Fibroblasts were washed three times with ice cold
phosphate buffered saline and harvested by scraping
into ice cold buffer (0.25 M sucrose, 1 mM MgCl2,
20 mM Tris, pH 7.4) with a cell scraper with anti-
proteolytics. The cells were recovered by centrifugation
at 1000g for 5 min and the cell pellet was then frozen at
�80 �C. For antioxidant enzyme activity measurements,
the control and psoriatic cell pellets were disrupted by
sonication in 500 ml of 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer,
pH 7, (whole cell lysates), and the same cellular sample
was used to assay each of the indicated activities within
the same experiment.

2.4. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities

As previously described [15], xanthineexanthine
oxidase was used to generate an O2

c� flux and the
reduction of 2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenol)-5 phe-
nyltetrazolium chloride (INT) to red formazan by O2

c�

was followed at 505 nm, 30 �C. Each assay tube
contained 50 mM (3-[cyclohexylamino]-1-propane-sul-
fonic acid) (CAPS) buffer, pH 10.2, for determination of
Cu,Zn-SOD activity [19], or 50 mM phosphate buffer,
pH 7.8, for determination of total SOD activity [20],
along with 1 mM EDTA, 25 mM INT, 50 mM xanthine,
1 U/ml catalase, 0.05 mM bathocuproin disulfonate
disodium salt (BCS), 0.13 mg/ml bovine serum albumin
(BSA), and enough xanthine oxidase to achieve the
required 100% of non-inhibition. BCS and BSA were
added to inhibit non-enzymatic scavenging of O2

c�. Mn-
SOD activity was determined by adding cyanide (2 mM)
to the assay mixture at pH 7.8 to inhibit Cu,Zn-SOD
activity, or was determined by subtracting the Cu,Zn-
SOD activity determined at pH 10.2 from the total SOD
activity measured at pH 7.8. The two methods gave
similar values (data not shown). All data are expressed
in units of SOD activity per mg of protein.

2.5. Western blot analysis

Cell pellets were prepared as described above. Then
cell lysates were prepared, protein levels were de-
termined and the lysates were then heated for 5 min at
95 �C in Laemmli sample buffer and analysed by
electrophoresis on 15% polyacrylamide gels (10 mg/
sample). Proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellu-
lose and Western blots were performed as described in
the Supersignal kit (Pierce, Bezons, France). The SOD
proteins were detected with a rabbit anti-human Mn-
SOD antibody and a goat anti-human Cu,Zn-SOD
antibody, both diluted 1000-fold (gift of Dr Taniguchi
N., Osaka, Japan).

2.6. Actinomycin D treatment

To determine the stability of Cu,Zn- and Mn-SOD
mRNA, with or without retinoic acid (1 mM), the three
different types (normal, non-lesional and lesional
psoriatic) of human fibroblast primary cultures were
untreated or treated for 48 h with 1 mM RA, and then
10 mg/ml ActD was added. Cells were collected, and
total RNA was isolated at the indicated time points.

2.7. Cycloheximide treatment

To inhibit protein synthesis, cells were incubated with
10 mg/ml cycloheximide, with or without retinoic acid
treatment (1 mM) for 48 h. To determine the turn over of
Cu,Zn- and Mn-SOD protein, cells were collected from
the three different types of human fibroblasts primary
cultures at the indicated time for western blot analysis.

2.8. RNA isolation and real time RT-PCR

Total RNA was extracted with RNA-Plus (Qbiogene,
Illkirch, France) from normal (N, Normal Skin),
lesional (LP, Lesional Psoriatic Skin) and non-lesional
(nLP, non-Lesional Psoriatic Skin) cultured fibroblasts,
and 1 mg of each sample was reverse-transcribed into
cDNA using a first-strand cDNA-synthesis kit (Amer-
sham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden).

Real-time quantitative PCR was conducted with the
TaqMan system (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems) for
the Cu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD steady state mRNA
levels with or without RA treatment or the LightCycler
system for the Cu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD mRNA
stability (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany)
using the DNA-binding dye SYBR Green for the
detection of PCR products according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions. Quantitative PCR was performed in
a total volume of 20 ml in the presence of 2 ml of cDNA,
2 ml of 10! LightCycler DNA Master SYBR Green I,
1.25 mM MgCl2, 25 pmol of both primers. After de-
naturation at 95 �C for 10 min, the samples underwent
40 cycles of amplification (15 s at 95 �C; 5 s at 60 �C and
8 s at 72 �C). Sense and antisense primers were re-
spectively: 5#-GGC GAC CTG GAA GTC CAA CT-3#
and 5#-CCA TCA GCA CCA CAG CCT TC-3# for PO;
5#-CTG AAG GCC TGC ATG GAT TC-3# and 5#-
CCA AGT CTC CAA CAT GCC TCT C-3# for Cu,Zn-
SOD; 5#-CGT GAC TTT GGT TCC TTT GAC A-3#
and 5#-AAG TGT CCC CGT TCC TTA TTG A-3# for
Mn-SOD. Experiments were performed with duplicates

for each point, and all results were normalized to P0
(RPLP0, human acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein)
cDNA detected in the same sample.

2.9. Analysis of statistical significance

Data were analysed by the ANOVA test.

3. Results

3.1. Retinoic acid treatment of psoriatic fibroblasts
decreased SOD enzymatic activities

In agreement with our previous findings [15], both
non-lesional (nLP) and lesional (LP) psoriatic fibroblasts
exhibit significantly higher levels of Mn-SOD and
Cu,Zn-SOD activities compared to normal (N) fibro-
blasts (Table 1). Treatment with 1 mM RA for 4 days
decreased the Cu,Zn-SOD activity determined in all
three cell types by 18% ( p! 0.005), 26% ( p! 0.005),
and 23% ( p! 0.025) for normal, nLP, and LP
fibroblasts, respectively. Interestingly, the Mn-SOD
activity was dramatically decreased by 1 mM RA
treatment for 4 days in psoriatic fibroblasts and returned
to levels equivalent to that in normal firbroblasts (83%
and 78% decrease in nLP and LP psoriatic fibroblasts,
respectively, p! 0.005), whereas RA had no effect on
Mn-SOD activity in normal fibroblasts (Table 1).

3.2. Time dependency of decreased SOD enzymatic
activities upon retinoic acid treatment

The effects of treating cells with RA for increasing
periods of time on Cu,Zn-SOD (panel A) and Mn-SOD
(panel B) activities are depicted in Fig. 1. RA treatment
of nLP, LP and normal fibroblasts showed only a slight
effect on Cu,Zn-SOD activity through 3 h. However,
a decrease in Cu,Zn-SOD activity was observed in all
three cell types at 96 h of treatment with RA, which was
maximal at 18 h (Fig. 1A). Importantly, RA had little
effect on the low basal level Mn-SOD activity present in
normal fibroblasts through 96 h of treatment, while
treatment of both nLP and LP psoriatic fibroblasts with
RA for 3 h resulted in a dramatic decrease in Mn-SOD
activity (Fig. 1B). This decrease in Mn-SOD activity in
response to RA treatment of psoriatic fibroblasts was
maintained through 96 h. At this time, the Mn-SOD
activity of psoriatic cells was similar to its basal level
determined in normal fibroblasts.

3.3. Retinoic acid effects on Cu,Zn-SOD
and Mn-SOD protein levels

The protein levels of Cu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD
present in control and RA-treated cells were analysed by
western blot and densitometric scanning of the auto-
radiographs (Fig. 2). Exposure to RA was found to
reduce the level of Cu,Zn-SOD protein in both normal
and psoriatic fibroblasts from 18 h through 96 h of
treatment (Fig. 2A). In contrast, no alteration in the
level of Mn-SOD protein was observed in any of the cell
types through 96 h of treatment with RA (Fig. 2B).

In another set of experiments, cells were treated for
18 h and 96 h. While the Mn-SOD protein level was not
changed by RA treatment of either normal or psoriatic
fibroblasts (Fig. 2D), RA treatment did result in
decreased levels of Cu,Zn-SOD protein in all three
different human primary cell types (nZ 4 of each
primary cultures, Fig. 2C). Thus, in comparison with
untreated cells, the mean valuesG SEM of Cu,Zn-SOD
protein levels were decreased by 17%G 4 ( p! 0.02),
19%G 2 ( p! 0.05) and 27%G 8 ( p! 0.03) in nor-
mal, nLP and LP RA-treated cells, respectively.

3.4. Analysis of Mn-SOD steady-state mRNA levels

Next, the Cu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD mRNA levels in
all three primary cell types were determined using real
time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction

(real time RT-PCR) (Fig. 3). To normalize the cDNA
concentration in all samples, a housekeeping gene (P0)
was amplified in the same experiment along with the
Mn-SOD and Cu,Zn-SOD genes. Normalization of the
results were obtained by establishing the ratio of Mn-
SOD/P0 and Cu,Zn-SOD/P0 [21]. The steady-state level
of Cu,Zn-SOD mRNA was not statistically different in
psoriatic fibroblasts obtained from non-lesional (nLP,

SOD activities were determined as described in Section 2. Data are

presented as meanG SEM (nZ 6). Each sample was assayed in

steady-state level of Mn-SOD was increased by 7 fold
( p! 0.001) and 48 fold ( p! 0.001), respectively, in
untreated nLP (nZ 4, meanGSEM, 9.85 AUG 0.88)

3.5. Effects of retinoic acid treatment on
Cu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD steady-state
mRNA levels

Given our finding that psoriatic fibroblasts had
significantly higher levels of Mn-SOD mRNA, we next
determined the effects of RA on both Cu,Zn-SOD and
Mn-SOD mRNA. As determined by real time RT-PCR,
the steady-state levels of Cu,Zn-SOD mRNA found in
psoriatic cells were significantly decreased in response to
RA treatment for 96 h (nLP 0Z 4.85 AUG 1.339, nLP

that the Mn-SOD mRNA levels present in normal
fibroblasts were not modulated by RA treatment for
96 h. However, exposure to RA for 96 h did signifi-
cantly decrease steady-state levels of Mn-SOD
mRNA in lesional psoriatic fibroblasts ( p! 0.001, LP

mRNA degradation, the stability of SOD mRNA was
measured in the presence of the transcriptional inhibitor
actinomycin D (ActD). The cells were treated or not by
RA, after which 10 mg/mL ActD was added. Total
mRNA was isolated at 0, 1, 3 and 6 h after ActD
addition and analysed by real time RT-PCR (Fig. 5).
The Cu,Zn-SOD mRNA and Mn-SOD mRNA were
stable in the three different types of human dermal
fibroblasts (non-lesional, lesional psoriatic, normal)
without or after 1 mM RA treatment (Fig. 4, panel A).
Thus we can conclude that the increased steady-state
Mn-SOD mRNA levels in psoriatic fibroblasts were not
due to an increase in mRNA stability.

3.7. Analysis of Cu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD
protein stability

To investigate whether Cu,Zn- and Mn-SOD protein
levels were stabilized by RA, normal and psoriatic
fibroblasts were pretreated with 1 mM RA for 48 h and
cycloheximide (10 mM/mL) added from 1 to 3 h to
inhibit protein synthesis. Cycloheximide alone or with
RA (1 mM) did not affect the expression of Cu,Zn-SOD
protein in all types of human psoriatic fibroblast
primary cultures (non-lesional, lesional psoriatic)
(Fig. 5, panels A, B, C). In addition, RA treatment of
normal and non-lesional and lesional psoriatic fibro-

Fig. 5. Analysis of Cu,Zn- and Mn-SOD protein stability in Normal (N), non-Lesional Psoriatic (nLP) and Lesional Psoriatic (LP) fibroblasts. As

shown in panels A and B, the three different primary cultures of fibroblasts were untreated or treated with RA for 48 h and cycloheximide (CHX)

(10 mg/mL) was added for 1 and 3 h. The molecular mass for Cu,Zn-SOD, Mn-SOD and b-actin is 15, 25 and 45 kDa, respectively. b-Actin serves as

loading control as shown in A and B. Immunoblots were quantified by densitometry and expressed as the ratio of the Cu,Zn-SOD/b-actin and Mn-

SOD/b-actin for each sample. The band intensities were quantified using ImageQuant software, Amersham Biosciences. Each point in the plot

protein levels (Fig. 5, panels D, E, F). Thus we can rule
out an effect of RA on Mn-SOD protein stability.

4. Discussion

The involvement of oxygen free radicals in a growing
list of diseases indicates a need for pharmaceutical agents
that may inhibit the production of free radicals. These
molecules may enhance radical scavenging systems,
which may then reverse oxidative damage to important
cellular components including those of the signal trans-
duction pathways. All-trans retinoic acid (RA), the
active metabolite of vitamin A, is critical in the
regulation of a number of biological processes, including
embryogenesis and cell growth [22,23] and it also has
been used in the treatment of psoriasis [24]. Previous
results, which demonstrated that RA treatment of cells
could reverse the oxidatively modified state of protein
kinase C [25], and of PKA [14], indicated that RA might
act to alter redox activities within the cell. However, its
mechanism of action is still unclear. To assess the role of
RA as an important regulator for treatment of psoriasis,
we have investigated the effects of RA on Cu,Zn-SOD
and Mn-SOD activity as well as mRNA and protein
levels in normal and psoriatic fibroblasts.

Retinoic acid treatment of psoriatic (nLP and
LP) fibroblasts produced a significant, time-dependent
decrease in Mn-SOD activity and mRNA to the basal
levels observed in normal fibroblasts. As increased Mn-
SOD activity occurs in response to an oxidative stress
and particularly in response to superoxide anions, the
antioxidant effects of RA treatment results in a reduction
of Mn-SOD activity in the psoriatic cells to basal levels.
Interestingly, the amount of Mn-SOD protein found in
these cells was not modified by RA treatment. However,
discrepancies between mRNA and protein levels have
also been reported by others. Ahlemeyer et al. [26]
showed that staurosporine did not influence the mRNA
levels of Cu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD, but decreased the
protein levels and the activity of both enzymes in
cultures from neonatal rat hippocampus. Tsan et al. [27]



76 P. Gerbaud et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 24 (2005) 69e78
showed that hyperoxia-induced increase in the mRNA
level of Mn-SOD in the lung was not associated with an
increase in the protein level or enzymatic activity of Mn-
SOD. Niu et al. [28] found an induction of the Mn-SOD
mRNA by lipopolysaccharides in rat astrocytes, with
a constant Mn-SOD protein level. These observations
suggest that SOD protein levels could be dissociated
from their synthesis and from their enzyme activities.
The fact that RA decreases mRNA levels of Mn-SOD in
psoriatic fibroblasts without a significant decrease in
protein levels could be explained by the stability of these
enzymes in time course of our experiments. Our results
are in agreement with a 5e6 h half-life for Mn-SOD
[29]. It is also possible that the RA treatment has altered
the subcellular distribution of the protein. For example,
if the RA treatment enhanced protein transport into the
lysozome or proteosome through post-translational
modifications such as ubiqutination, it is possible that
while total cellular protein levels were not changed, the
enzymatic activity was reduced due to the change in
subcellular localization. This hypothesis awaits further
investigation.

Enzyme activities often are modulated by post-
translational modification of the protein. Covalent
modifications such as disulfide formation, phosphoryla-
tion, acetylation, glycosylation and nitration all have
been reported [30]. An additional modification termed
retinoylation also has been observed in cells treated with
retinoic acid [31,32]. Following activation of retinoic
acid in a coenzyme A-mediated reaction, a thioester
bond between protein and RA can be created. The RI
and RII regulatory subunits of PKA were found to be
retinoylated in HL 60 cells [32], and we also observed
retinoylation of RI and RII in normal and psoriatic
fibroblasts [33]. Retinoylation of the RII regulatory
subunit, as well as total protein retinoylation, was
observed to be increased in psoriatic cells. This raises the
possibility that Mn-SOD could be covalently modified
by retinoylation in response to RA treatment of
psoriatic cells, thus explaining our observed decrease
in enzyme activity. Finally we recently have shown an
increase of carbonylation in psoriatic cells, which could
also be responsible for protein modification and de-
creased enzyme activity [34].

Retinoic acid treatment had a differential effect on
the modulation of Cu,Zn-SOD. The basal level of
Cu,Zn-SOD mRNA was not significantly altered in
psoriatic as compared to normal fibroblasts, whereas
the basal Mn-SOD mRNA level was significantly
elevated in psoriatic fibroblasts. In studies with
psoriatic epidermis, Löntz et al. [35] reported that the
expression of Cu,Zn-SOD mRNA was unchanged in
psoriatic (nLP and LP) compared to normal skin. In
our case, we have determined that retinoic acid
treatment resulted in decreased levels of Cu,Zn-SOD
mRNA in psoriatic cells. However, the mechanism(s)
underlying the down-regulation of Cu,Zn-SOD expres-
sion remains unclear. In fact, there is little information
concerning factors which may regulate Cu,Zn-SOD
transcription, as Cu,Zn-SOD is constitutively expressed
in primary cultures of dermal fibroblasts, and is not
regulated by cytokines and growth factors [36]. Re-
cently, Frank et al. [37] showed a direct coupling of
Cu,Zn-SOD mRNA expression levels to the presence
of nitric oxide, since Cu,Zn-SOD levels declined during
acute inflammation (endotoxemic shock) in the pres-
ence of a selective inhibitor of iNOS and without
involvement of the soluble guanylate cyclase. This
suggested the possibility that under conditions of
chronic inflammation, such as in psoriatic fibroblasts,
Cu,Zn-SOD mRNA expression might be regulated by
H2O2, NO and peroxinitrite.

Results presented here showed that RA treatment of
psoriatic fibroblasts for 18 h down-regulated Cu,Zn-
SOD mRNA steady-state levels. These results suggest
either transcriptional regulation or a modification of
mRNA stability of Cu,Zn-SOD mRNA expression with
RA treatment of psoriatic cells, but a translational
regulation of Cu,Zn-SOD levels in normal cells.
Retinoids appear to exert their biological effects through
multiple gene regulatory nuclear factors [38e40]. An
activated retinoidereceptor complex can regulate gene
expression by two distinct mechanisms. It can activate
transcription by binding to a retinoid response element
in the promoter of specific genes. However, no retinoid
response element was found within the promoter regions
of the Cu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD genes. Alternatively,
RA can indirectly repress the activity of other nuclear
transcription factors such as AP-1 [41,42]. The activated
retinoid receptor complex can interact with cofactor
proteins that are required for AP-1 mediated gene
transcription factor. However, no binding sequence for
the AP-1 transcription factor has been found within the
proximal promoter of Cu,Zn-SOD. Thus, RA regula-
tion of Cu,Zn-SOD gene expression may require
interaction with other cellular components, such as
other cellular retinoic acid binding proteins (CRABPs,
see for review Noy [43]). The possible involvement of
CRABPs in mediating this down-regulatory effect of RA
on Cu,Zn-SOD expression is of interest in view of the
finding that CRABP II levels are elevated in psoriatic
skin [44] and awaits further analysis. While in this report
we studied the effect of RA on psoriatic fibroblasts, as
an immunologic sentinel. RA has other cellular targets
in psoriasis such as keratinocytes and T lymphocytes.
Thus it is quite possible that Cu,Zn-SOD could also be
involved in the prevention of T-cell apoptosis [46]. This
hypothesis awaits further testing.

In conclusion, RA treatment of primary psoriatic
fibroblasts resulted in a significant decrease in the
elevated level of Mn-SOD activity found in these cells
at a level similar to that in normal fibroblasts. This



77P. Gerbaud et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 24 (2005) 69e78
regulatory effect of RA could be at the level of protein
covalent modification or subcellular localization or at
the Mn-SOD mRNA steady-state level, since there was
no significant change in total cellular Mn-SOD protein
levels. Retinoic acid treatment of both normal and
psoriatic fibroblasts also caused a decrease in Cu,Zn-
SOD activity that appeared to be at the level of
transcriptional regulation. Thus our data begins to
provide a biochemical basis for the use of RA in the
treatment of psoriasis.

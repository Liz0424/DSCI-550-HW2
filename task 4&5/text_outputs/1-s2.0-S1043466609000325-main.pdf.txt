Vascular endothelial growth inhibitor TNFSF15 (TL1A), a ligand for TNFRSF25 (DR3) and decoy receptor
TNFRSF6B (DcR3), is expressed in human pulmonary arterial (HPAEC) and lung microvascular (HMVEC)
endothelial cells where it might modulate inflammation and sickle vasculopathy. Pulmonary disease,
endothelial abnormalities and inflammation are prominent features of sickle cell disease (SCD). Butyrate
has opposing effects on endogenous TNFSF15 expression in pulmonary endothelium, acting as an inhib-
itor in HPAEC and an inducer in HMVEC. Similar effects were observed with a known cytokine TNF-a in
these two cell types. Furthermore the TNFSF15 promoter utilized different combinations of cis-elements
for its expression in these two cell types. AP1-like and G-rich sequence elements were critical for pro-
moter activity in large vessel HPAEC while AP1-like and NF-jB consensus sequence elements were
required in small vessel HMVEC. The requirement of an NF-jB sequence element by the TNFSF15 pro-
moter in HMVEC but not in HPAEC supported the notion that HMVEC might be a target of inflammation
and vasoocclusion in SCD. The dual effects of butyrate-dependant TNFSF15 regulation in lung endothe-
lium may help in identify inflammatory pathways and understand the role of HMVEC in pathogenesis
of vasoocclusion in SCD.

1. Introduction

Modifications of the endothelial cell (EC) phenotype can occur
after exposure to sickle erythrocytes (RBCs) and/or plasma [1,2].
Exposure of cultured bovine, human pulmonary artery, or human
lung microvascular endothelial cells (BPAEC, HPAEC and HMVEC)
to plasma taken from SCD patients during the acute chest syn-
drome resulted in up-regulation of mRNA expression of the vaso-
constrictor endothelin-1 (ET-1) and dysregulation of nitric oxide
(NO) metabolism [1,3]. Exposure of EC to RBCs from SCD patients
without a recent acute vasoocclusive event (steady-state) induced
expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and
intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) [2]. These data suggest
a role for chronic inflammation in sickle vasoocclusion as altera-
tions in the EC phenotype occurred upon exposure to blood com-
ponents from SCD patients even when they appeared clinically
well. TNFSF15 encodes a cytokine belonging to the tumor necrosis
factor ligand family that is predominantly expressed on endothe-
lial cells and functions as an autocrine cytokine, inhibiting angio-
genesis, cell proliferation, and tumor growth as well as

stabilizing the vasculature [4]. This cytokine plays a role in the
induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and extracellular matrix
degrading enzymes in atherogenesis [5]. Its expression is up-regu-
lated in inflammatory bowel disease, suggesting a role in inflam-
mation [6,7]. It also functions as a T-cell co-stimulator leading to
increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines [8].

Sickle vasculopathy is, at least in part, a result of endothelial
damage and inflammation. Perturbation of the microvascular
endothelium, because of its important role in inflammation and
maintenance of vascular tone, may play a role in sickle vasoocclu-
sion [9,10]. EC activation may differ between large vessels and the
microvasculature; this heterogeneity could be a factor in the path-
ophysiology of diseases across different vascular beds. In earlier
studies, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were used
for endothelial cell activation studies, but concerns about EC heter-
ogeneity makes this cell type less suitable to study pulmonary
complications of SCD. Since much of vasoocclusion occurs at the le-
vel of microvasculature, we hypothesized that the pulmonary
microvascular endothelium could be a primary target for cytokines
during the acute chest syndrome and possibly other types of sickle
cell lung disease.

Sodium butyrate and similar compounds can induce fetal hemo-
globin expression in SCD and these agents might be therapeutically

useful [11,12]. Butyrate is also known to modulate gene expres-
sion in the endothelium. In HUVEC, exposure to butyrate in-
duced expression of ICAM-1, E-selectin and endothelin-1 [13].
Sodium phenyl butyrate increased VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 expres-
sion while down-regulating ET-1 in transformed human bone
marrow endothelial cells [14]. Butyrate’s effects are not re-
stricted to the endothelium as it is also known to suppress
pro-inflammatory cytokines in monocytes [15]. These studies
suggest that butyrate could potentially act as an immune modu-
lator in endothelial cells. In the present study, we examined the
effects of butyrate on TNFSF15 expression in HPAEC and HMVEC
while comparing these effects to those of another known im-
mune modulator, TNF-a. This study may provide new insights
into the role of TNFSF15 in inflammation within microvascular
endothelium.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Cell cultures

HPAEC and HMVEC (passage 6–9) were grown in EGM-2 and
EGM-2 MV media supplemented with growth factors and 10%
fetal bovine serum (Clonetics, Walkersville, MD) under humidi-
fied conditions (5% CO2) at 37 �C. Sodium butyrate, 4 mM (Sig-
ma–Aldrich, USA) or recombinant human TNF-a, 40 ng/ml
(Millipore Corp., Temecula, CA) was added directly to the med-
ia. For experiments involving endogenous TNFSF15 expression,
cells were incubated in presence of butyrate or TNF-a for 20,
40 min or 1, 2, 6 or 24 h. At the end of each incubation period,
the cells were washed with PBS and lysed for RNA and protein
isolation.

2.2. RNA isolation and RT-PCR assay

Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA) and treated with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen). DNA
free RNA (0.25 lg) was used as the template for one-step RT-PCR
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The forward and reverse primers used
were: (a) TNFSF15—50-ATGGGCCGAGGATCTGGGACTGAGC-30 and
5‘-CTATAGTAAGAAGGTTTTATCTTC-30 (750 bp fragment); (b) TL1-
5‘-GCAAAGTCTACAGTTTCCCAATGAGAAAATTAATCC-30 and the
same reverse primer as used for TNFSF15 (522 bp fragment); (c)
GAPDH—5‘-ATGACATCAAGAAGGTGGTG-30 and 5‘-CATACCAGGAA
ATGAGCTGG-30 (177 bp fragment). The following conditions were
used: initial incubation, 30 min (53 �C), 2 min (94 �C), 40 s dena-
turation (94 �C), 40 s annealing (55 �C) and 1 min elongation
(68 �C) for a total of 30 cycles. The PCR products were run on
1.5% agarose gels and bands were visualized. Relative levels of
TNFSF15 RNA expression were obtained from densitometry analy-
sis; the intensity of the TNFSF15 RT-PCR band was divided by the
corresponding GAPDH band and the values obtained were plotted
against each time point. Densitometry image analysis was done by
using software available at http://rsb.info.nih.gov/. Each experi-
ment was performed in triplicate.

2.3. Western blot analysis of TNFSF15 protein

HPAEC and HMVEC were plated and incubated in the presence
of butyrate (4 mM) or TNF-a (40 ng/ml) for 20, 40 min, 1, 2, 6 or
24 h. Following incubation, cells were washed with PBS and lysed
in RIPA buffer containing a cocktail of protease inhibitors [16]. The
lysate was cleared of cellular debris, protein concentration was
determined by using the Bio-Rad Dc protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercu-
les, CA) and samples (40 lg) loaded onto a 10% SDS–PAGE gel.
Gel-fractionated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose
membrane and blotted with an anti-human TL1A primary antibody
raised against human TNFSF15 peptide (1:200 dilution) (Biolegend,
San Diego, CA), followed by a goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP secondary
antibody (1:5000 dilution). Bound antibody was detected via an
enhanced chemiluminescence fluorography reagent kit (Western
lightning chemiluminescence reagent, Perkin Elmer, USA). Use of
an anti-tubulin goat anti-mouse antibody (Santa Cruz Biotech, San-
ta Cruz, CA) served as an internal control for these experiments.
Relative levels of TNFSF15 protein were determined via densitom-
etry and corrected for tubulin expression. Each experiment was
performed in triplicate.

2.4. Reporter plasmid constructs

HPAEC DNA was used to amplify the TNFSF15 promoter, a 1417
base pair fragment (�1390/+27 from initiation site, ref Gene
NM_005118). The forward and reverse primers used were 50-
TCCAGGCTGTGACATAACCA-30 and 50-CAAAGCTCAGTCCCAGATCC-30.
The amplified product was cloned into p-GEM-T Easy vector (Pro-
mega, Madison, WI), releasing the insert with Not1 and end-filling
the fragment. The excised and end-filled fragment was cloned into
the basic pGL3 (Promega) luciferase reporter vector at the Sma1
site in the multi-cloning site. The promoter orientation was con-
firmed by restriction enzyme analysis and sequencing. A series of
50-end deletion constructs of the TNFSF15 promoter were gener-
ated. The deleted constructs were designated: p-89-luc, p-188-luc,
p-444-luc, p-540-luc, p-912-luc, p-1056-luc, p-1228-luc and p-
1390-luc.

In the p-188-luc and p-444-luc constructs, we identified a mod-
ification of the classic AP1 site with 80% homology; this sequence
element was designated as AP1-like motif. The G-rich, AP1-like and
NF-jB binding sequences were mutated individually and in combi-
nation (described in Fig. 4), using the Quick change multi-site-di-
rected PCR based mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). These
mutations in consensus AP1 and NF-jB sequences have previously
been reported to abolish the functional activity of these sequence
elements [17–19]. All the mutant constructs were confirmed by
sequencing. Plasmids constructs were purified (Qiagen plasmid
kit) before electroporation into the endothelial cells.

2.5. Cell transfection and luciferase assay

HPAEC and HMVEC were grown to a density of 1.5 � 106 cells
per 100 � 15 mm plate, washed with PBS, trypsinized, centrifuged,
and resuspended in media containing 10% FBS. A total of 1.25–
1.5 � 106 cells were transfected with 12 lg of pGL-3 basic lucifer-
ase reporter plasmid linked to various constructs of the TNFSF15
promoter and 0.14 lg of pRL-SV40 Renilla luciferase (85:1 dilution)
as an internal control reporter, in a final volume of 400 ll. Reporter
plasmids and cells were incubated on ice for 10 min and electropo-
rated (Bio-Rad Electroporator) at 200 V/975 lF for HPAEC and at
180 V/950 lF for HMVEC in a 0.4 cm cuvette. Three electropora-
tions were performed for each plasmid. After electroporation, cells
were allowed to recover for 10 min at room temperature, pooled
and equal volumes were placed into 6 or 24 well culture plates
with 1–2 ml of media per well. In the preliminary promoter trans-
fections studies, the luciferase activity was monitored up to 48 h.
The promoter activity was found to peak at 6–8 h after transfec-
tion; hence 6 h of incubation time was selected for all transfection
studies. At the end of incubation period, media was aspirated; cells
were washed with PBS, lysed and assayed for luciferase activity
using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison,
WI) and a Bio-Rad Luminometer. Results presented as RLU, a ratio
of pGL-3 promoter construct firefly luciferase values to the Renilla
luciferase internal control.

3. Results

3.1. Effect of butyrate on endogenous TNFSF15 expression

The expression pattern of TNFSF15 in HPAEC and HMVEC was
studied using RT-PCR and Western analysis. The ECs were incu-
bated in presence or absence of butyrate (4 mM) for 20 or
40 min or 1, 2, 6 or 24 h and at the end of each incubation period,
RNA and protein were isolated. Using TNFSF15 gene specific prim-
ers, a 750 bp fragment was amplified in both cell types, and is ex-
pressed at high levels in HPAEC when compared to HMVEC
(Fig. 1A, lane C). The presence of this fragment was indicative of
full length TNFSF15 transcript. This transcript is a longer variant
of TL1/VEGI, a protein with antiangiogenic activity. When TL1 spe-
cific primers were used, no amplified product of this transcript
(522 bp) was detected in either cell types (data not shown). This
observation suggests that TNFSF15 (TL1A) is predominantly ex-
pressed in the two pulmonary endothelial cell types studied. Using
a TNFSF15 specific antibody, a 31 kDa band corresponding to
TNFSF15 (TL1A) protein in both cell types was detected and base-
line protein expression was higher in HPAEC as compared to
HMVEC (Fig. 1B, lane C).

Next the effect of sodium butyrate on TNFSF15 RNA and protein
expression in these two cell types was investigated. Butyrate’s ef-
fects on gene expression were observed after 20 min of exposure
in both HPAEC and HMVEC. In HPAEC, butyrate inhibited RNA
expression of after 20 min of exposure; this inhibitory effect

was lost at 2 h and at later time points. In HMVEC, co-incubation
with butyrate for 20 min induced RNA expression and this effect
persisted up to 24 h. The effect of butyrate on TNFSF15 expression
was more robust in HMVEC as compared to HPAEC. The effect of
butyrate on gene expression was also observed at the protein le-
vel in these two cell types and followed a similar time course
(*p < .05); (Fig. 1A and B).

3.2. Effect of TNF-a on endogenous TNFSF15 expression

Co-incubating HPAEC and HMVEC with TNF-a (40 ng/ml) pro-
duced effects on TNFSF15 expression similar to those observed with
butyrate. In HPAEC, TNFSF15 RNA and protein expression was inhib-
ited after 20 min, while in HMVEC, expression was induced at
20 min and continued to be higher up to 24 h of incubation
(*p < .05) (Fig. 2A and B). These data suggest that TNF-a and butyrate
have similar effects on TNFSF15 expression in these two cell types.

3.3. Identification of TNFSF15 minimal functional promoter element in
HPAEC and HMVEC

Having established a differential effect of butyrate on endoge-
nous TNFSF15 expression in HPAEC and HMVEC, our next step
was to investigate whether this effect could be attributed to the
use of different sequence elements within the TNFSF15 promoter
(�1390/+27). For this purpose, a series of 50-deletion constructs
of the TNFSF15 promoter were generated (Fig. 3A).

In HPAEC, the promoter region sufficient for minimal promoter
activity was identified between the �89 and �188 nucleotides, 50
to the initiation codon (p-188-luc). Other promoter deletion con-
structs, p-444-luc, p-540-luc, p-912-luc, p-1056-luc and p-1228-luc
exhibited higher activity than either p-188-luc or p-1390/+27-luc,
suggesting the presence of some activator sequences located be-
tween 50 to p-188-luc and p-1390-luc. Deletions at 30 of p-188-luc

constructs. Base pair scale is represented on the X-axis for each of the deleted promoters listed on the Y-axis. These promoter constructs along with the control plasmid pRL-

activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity encoded by co-transfected pRL-SV40 control plasmid, mean luciferase activity expressed as relative luciferase units (RLU)
is presented (n = 3). The p-188-luc and p-1390-luc promoters have higher activity than the p-89-luc promoter in HPAEC (*p < 0.01). In HMVEC, p-444-luc and p-1390-luc
promoter activity was significantly higher than the p-188-luc promoter (**p < 0.05).

(p-89-luc) reduced most of its activity (Fig. 3B). These results indi-
cate the presence of critical minimal regulatory elements in p-188-
luc, essential for its expression in HPAEC.

These p-1390-luc deletion constructs were also tested in
HMVEC, p-188-luc exhibited little activity, implying that p-188-
luc does not have all of the required sequence elements necessary
for its expression in HMVEC. Nevertheless, the p-444-luc construct
activity was comparable to that of p-1390-luc in HMVEC, suggest-
ing that p-444-luc is the essential minimal promoter functional in
HMVEC (Fig. 3C). From these observations, it is reasonable to con-
clude that the TNFSF15 promoter utilizes different promoter se-
quences for its expression in HPAEC and HMVEC.

3.4. G-rich and AP1-like sequence elements are necessary for TNFSF15
promoter activity in HPAEC

Our next goal was to identify the sequence elements critical for
minimal promoter activity in each of these cell types. Several con-
sensus sequences were identified in the p-188-luc promoter region
(�188/+27) including a putative AP1-like binding domain (�102 to
�92), a G-rich sequence (�128 to�118) as well as the MZF1, ADR1,
GKLF and NF-AT sequence elements. The functional roles of the

significant when compared to unaltered p-444-luc in HMVEC. The sequence motifs and
AP1-like and G-rich sequence in modulating p-188-luc construct
activity was tested by mutating core nucleotide bases in these se-
quence elements (G-rich, AP1 and G-AP1 mutant constructs). The
p-188-luc-AP1 mutant has significantly decreased activity and
G-rich sequence alteration also reduced the promoter activity;
mutations in the G-rich region also partially abolished the MFZ1
element (NGNGGGGA) located 50 to the putative G-rich element.
When both AP1-like and G-rich elements were mutated in p-188-
luc, the inhibition was greater than with either mutated sequence
element alone, suggesting a synergistic effect. Based on these re-
sults, it appears that both the G-rich and AP1-like sequences have
critical roles in regulating the TNFSF15 promoter expression in
HPAEC (Fig. 4A). Another consensus AP1-like binding site exists
at �34 to �26 region in the construct p-89-luc, but since this pro-
moter construct has little functional activity, this sequence is unli-
kely to contribute to the TNFSF15 promoter activity.

3.5. NF-jB sequence element is critical to TNFSF15 promoter activity
in HMVEC

construct is not sufficient to allow its expression in HMVEC. It is
likely that sequences 50 to the p-188-luc region are critical to its
expression in this cell type. A sequence motif search in this region
led to identification of a NF-jB sequence in p-444-luc (�314 to
�305 region). Altering this NF-jB sequence significantly reduced
p-444-luc construct expression in HMVEC. Although G-rich and
AP1-like sequence mutants also reduce the p-444-luc activity, these
two sequence motifs alone can not drive the promoter in the absence
of NF-jB element. Furthermore, altering both AP1-like and NF-jB
sequence elements in p-444-luc did not produce a significant change
in promoter activity compared with mutation of the NF-jB site alone
(Fig. 4B). However, altering NF-jB sequence in p-444-luc did not in-
hibit its activity in HPAEC, but altering both AP1-like and NF-jB ele-
ments inhibited activity and produced effects similar to altering the
AP1-like sequence element (Fig. 4C). Taken together, these observa-
tions imply that, in HMVEC, even though AP1-like and G-rich se-
quence elements may play a role, the presence of NF-jB sequence
element is critical for TNFSF15 promoter activity. Conversely, in
HPAEC, the AP1-like sequence element and not the NF-jB site is re-
quired for TNFSF15 minimal promoter activity.
4. Discussion

Our goal was to explore the expression pattern of TNFSF15 in
HPAEC and HMVEC and define the effects of butyrate or TNF-a
on its expression. Induction of TNFSF15 has been associated with
inflammation, one of the proposed mediators of sickle vasoocclu-
sion [6–8]. The existence of heterogeneity in endogenous TNFSF15
expression among endothelial cell types suggests that differential
effects on expression may be induced by butyrate. Vasoocclusive
episodes and hemolytic anemia are hallmarks of the pathophysiol-
ogy of SCD; the acute chest syndrome and pulmonary hypertension
are prominent examples of vasoocclusive and hemolysis-related
complications, respectively. The endothelium appears to play a role
in the pathogenesis of these major pulmonary complications of
SCD. Because of this, we choose to extend previous studies cen-
tered on other vascular beds to an evaluation of the major endo-
thelial cell types within the lung, HPAEC and HMVEC. These
results suggest that TNFSF15 could play a role in vasoocclusion
within the pulmonary vasculature.

Endogenous TNFSF15 expression at the base line was higher in
HPAEC compared with HMVEC, supporting the notion that expres-
sion is heterogeneous among cell types. Moreover, co-incubation
with either butyrate or TNF-a produced differing effects on
TNFSF15 expression in these two cell types, even though the down-
stream effects were similar with butyrate in both. Butyrate or TNF-
a inhibited TNFSF15 RNA and protein expression in HPAEC, indicat-
ing a possible anti-inflammatory role of these two agents in large
vessel endothelium. In contrast, the induction of TNFSF15 RNA
and protein expression in HMVEC by butyrate or TNF-a suggested
a pro-inflammatory role of these agents in small vessel endothe-
lium. We have not investigated the mechanism of butyrate’s effects
on TNFSF15 expression in these endothelial cell types. Butyrate has
been reported to regulate gene expression via the AP1 binding se-
quences and histone acetylation [20] SP1/SP3 multi-protein inter-
actions [21,22], a CRE motif [23], interaction with NF-jB signal
transduction pathway [24] and inhibition of histone deacetylase
[25]. We found that TNFSF15 gene can be either induced or re-
pressed in response to butyrate, depending upon the cell type
studied.

Although the mechanisms for the TNFSF15 response to butyrate
or TNF-a in these two lung EC types is not clear, it might relate to
the selective use of promoter sequence elements as suggested by
our promoter deletion studies. It would of interest to establish
whether the TNFSF15 promoter uses the same or different cis-ele-
ments to regulate the gene expression in the two pulmonary endo-
thelial cell types and this might help in understanding the
mechanism of the differential effects of butyrate. To begin to ad-
dress the mechanism responsible for the regulation of TNFSF15
expression, we identified different regions of the TNFSF15 promoter
that are critical for gene expression in each cell type. The minimal
promoter construct p-188-luc was functional in HPAEC but not in
HMVEC; altering the core AP1-like sequence element along with
G-rich sequence in p-188-luc eliminated most of the activity of this
construct. This minimal promoter has two putative AP1-like and
one G-rich sequences, but only one of these AP1-like sequence ele-
ments (�102 to �92) contributed to the minimal promoter activ-
ity. The NF-jB sequence element (�314 to �305) did not appear
to be essential for minimal promoter activity in HPAEC as its dele-
tion in p-188-luc or alteration in p-444-luc, respectively, did not af-
fect the activity. In HMVEC, the promoter construct p-444-luc was
functional and its activity appeared to be due to the NF-jB se-
quence element present in this construct. The G-rich and AP1-like
sequence elements do appear to exert additional effects on pro-
moter activity. These results suggest that NF-jB, possibly in tan-
dem with AP1-like sequence elements, drive the TNFSF15
promoter in HMVEC. Interestingly, this NF-jB sequence element
was also critical for TNFSF15 activity in murine cerebral endothelial
cells suggesting an overlap with other endothelial cell types [26].

The use of an NF-jB sequence motif by the TNFSF15 promoter in
HMVEC, and its pro-inflammatory response to butyrate suggests
that HMVEC are a target of inflammation as NF-jB is a key tran-
scription factor in the inflammatory response [27]. Moreover, the
recent description of TNFSF15 as a critical gene in gut inflammation
[7] supports the notion that HMVEC are targets of inflammation
and that TNFSF15 might play an important role in this process.
Hence, TNFSF15 up-regulation in lung microvascular endothelium
could provide a pro-inflammatory milieu favoring SCD vasoocclu-
sion. During vasoocclusion, the endothelium in SCD becomes
pro-inflammatory via the up-regulation of adhesion molecules
[28,29]. Endothelial activation can occur in this setting by a variety
of mechanisms. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a can be
released by circulating monocytes and activate the endothelium
[30]. Low oxygen tension within the vasculature results in HbS
polymerization, adherence of sickle cells to the vascular endothe-
lium and microvasculature occlusion [31,32]. Co-incubation of
sickle erythrocytes with HPAEC resulted in up-regulation of the
adhesion molecules, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 [2], suggesting a role
for the sickle erythrocyte in the modulation of inflammation. Leu-
kocyte and platelet adherence to the endothelium also occur and
might further enhance this process [33–35]. Abnormal interactions
between sickle erythrocytes, leukocytes and platelets with the
endothelium could trigger the expression of cytokines such as
TNFSF15 that can activate or inactivate genes essential for normal
endothelial function. The observation of a pro-inflammatory re-
sponse to butyrate in HMVEC raises the possibility that pharmaco-
logical use of this agent to induce fetal hemoglobin might
paradoxically perturb the endothelium.

We show that both butyrate and TNF-a produce differential ef-
fects on TNFSF15 expression in HPAEC and HMVEC. The induction
of TNFSF15 gene expression in HMVEC by butyrate suggests that
up-regulation of this gene could produce a pro-inflammatory envi-
ronment that might contribute to the pathogenesis of sickle
vasoocclusion.

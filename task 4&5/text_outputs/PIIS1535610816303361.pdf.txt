In the original article, which shows that the expression of Notch-ICD leads to the formation of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas,

there is a duplication of actin blots in Figures 2G, 6F, and S2F.

Figure 2G shows the expression levels of cyclin E, cylin A, and p27 in wild-type and Notch-ICD mice undergoing liver regeneration

after partial hepatectomy. The actin blot corresponding to the protein extracts from the wild-type mouse livers was duplicated and

inadvertently used for the Notch-ICD mouse livers. The correct actin blot is now shown in the revised Figure 2G below.

In Figure 6F, the actin blot derived from Figure 6A, which shows that downregulation of Notch 1 by siRNA leads to a reduction of cyclin

E levels, was erroneously duplicated in Figure 6F, which shows that inhibition of Notch activity by DAPT leads to cyclin E downre-

gulation. In the revised Figure 6F shown below, the correct actin blot has been used.

Finally, in Figure S2F, the blot for cleaved Notch expression had been duplicated and erroneously labeled as Cyclin E. The correct

cyclin E blot is now shown in the revised figure below.

While none of these errors affect the results or conclusions of this work, the authors would like to apologize for any confusion this

might have caused.

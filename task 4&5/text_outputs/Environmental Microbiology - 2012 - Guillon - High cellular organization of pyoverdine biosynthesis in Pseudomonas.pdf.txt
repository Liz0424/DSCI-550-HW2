Summary

Pyoverdine I (PVDI) is the major siderophore pro-
duced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 to import
iron. Its biosynthesis requires the coordinated action
of cytoplasmic, periplasmic and membrane proteins.
The individual enzymatic activities of these proteins
are well known. However, their subcellular distribu-
tion in particular areas of the cytoplasm, periplasm, or
within the membrane has never been investigated.
We used chromosomal replacement to generate
P. aeruginosa strains producing fluorescent fusions
with PvdA, one of the initial enzymes in the biosyn-
thetic pathway of PVDI in the cytoplasm, and PvdQ,
involved in the maturation of PVDI in the periplasm.
Cellular fractionation indicated that a substantial
amount of PvdA-YFP was located in the mem-
brane fraction. Epifluorescence microscopy imaging
showed that PvdA-YFP was mainly clustered at the
old cell pole of bacteria, indicating a polar segrega-
tion of the protein. Epifluorescence and TIRF imaging
on cells expressing labelled PvdQ showed that this
enzyme was uniformly distributed in the periplasm, in
contrast with PvdA-YFP. The description of the intra-
cellular distribution of these enzymes contributes to
the understanding of the PVDI biosynthetic pathway.

Introduction

Iron acquisition challenges bacteria, as almost all living
organisms, because this metal is on the one hand a

cofactor of numerous redox-dependent key enzymes and
on the other hand is poorly bioavailable. As a conse-
quence, bacteria have evolved biosynthetic pathways to
produce and secrete high-affinity sequestrating agents
called siderophores. These molecules efficiently chelate
iron in the bacterial environment such that it can be trans-
ported back into the microorganism (Boukhalfa and Crum-
bliss, 2002; Braun and Hantke, 2011; Hider and Kong,
2011).

The opportunistic Gram-negative bacterium
Pseudomonas aeruginosa secretes a fluorescent sidero-
phore called pyoverdine (PVDI) (Meyer and Abdallah,
1978; Schalk, 2008). This chelator is composed of three
parts: (i) a chromophore derived from 2,3-diamino-6,7-
dihydroxyquinoline, (ii) a peptide moiety consisting of
eight amino acids bound to the carboxylic group of the
chromophore and (iii) a dicarboxylic acid or dicarboxylic
amide attached to the C-3 of the chromophore (Demange
et al., 1990). PVDI synthesis starts in the cytoplasm with
the synthesis of a non-fluorescent precursor (Hannauer
et al., 2012) and ends in the periplasm (Yeterian et al.,
2010a). The backbone of PVDI is assembled in the cyto-
plasm and requires the coordinated activity of four large
cytoplasmic modular enzymes known as nonribosomal
peptide synthetases (NRPSs) – PvdL, PvdI, PvdJ and
PvdD (Mossialos et al., 2002; Ackerley et al., 2003; Ravel
and Cornelis, 2003) – and enzymes producing the sub-
strates for the four NRPSs (Visca et al., 2007). PvdA, a
L-ornithine hydroxylase, and PvdF, a hydroxyornithine
transformylase, catalyse the transformation of L-ornithine
into L-formyl-Nd-hydroxyornithine, which is a substrate for
the NRPSs, PvdI and PvdJ (McMorran et al., 2001;
Meneely et al., 2009). PvdH, an amidotransferase,
converts the L-aspartate b-semialdehyde into L-2,4-
diaminobutyrate, which is then incorporated into the
peptide chain by PvdL (Vandenende et al., 2004). The
PVDI synthesis starts with PvdL, which couples coen-
zyme A to a myristic acid in an ATP-dependent reaction
and delivers it to the L-Glu residue in the second domain
of PvdL (Mossialos et al., 2002; Gulick and Drake, 2011).
After incorporation of the first three residues – L-Glu,
L-Tyr and L-Dab – the other amino-acid residues are
incorporated by PvdI (for L-Ser, L-Arg, L-Ser and
L-OHOrn), PvdJ (for L-Lys and L-OHOrn), and PvdD (for

the two L-Thr) (Visca et al., 2007). The presence of a
myristic group on the first residue (L-Glu) probably keeps
the PVDI precursor at the inner membrane throughout the
biosynthetic process (Hannauer et al., 2012).

After formation of the PVDI backbone, which is non-
fluorescent and has a mysristic group on the L-Glu
residue (Hannauer et al., 2012), the precursor is trans-
ported across the inner membrane by an export
ABC transporter PvdE (Hannauer et al., 2010) and the
subsequent biosynthetic steps occur in the periplasm.
Biochemical and crystallographic studies suggested
that PvdQ, an N-terminal nucleophile hydrolase (Ntn-
hydrolase), is involved in the excision of the fatty-acid
chain (Gulick and Drake, 2011; Hannauer et al., 2012).
This is then followed by the cyclization of the chro-
mophore, which yields the fluorescent PVDI. The periplas-
mic enzymes (PvdN, PvdO and PvdP) (Ravel and
Cornelis, 2003; Lewenza et al., 2005), necessary for
PVDI production (Ochsner et al., 2002; Lamont and
Martin, 2003; Voulhoux et al., 2006; Yeterian et al.,
2010a), are probably implicated in this step. Mutation of
PvdN and PvdP abolish the secretion of fluorescent PVDI,
indicating that these proteins must be involved in PVDI
chromophore formation (Yeterian et al., 2010a). The efflux
pump PvdRT-OpmQ has been implicated in the delivery of
newly synthesized PVDI from the periplasm into the extra-
cellular medium (Hannauer et al., 2010).

The activities of various enzymes involved in PVDI
biosynthesis in P. aeruginosa have been described.
However, it is hard to imagine how this highly complex
mechanism, with sequential steps in all cell compart-
ments, is orchestrated to efficiently yield a mature
complex siderophore. Over the past decade, numerous
GFP-tagged proteins have been identified at specific
intracellular locations such as the poles of the cells, indi-
cating that bacteria have a degree of intracellular organi-
zation (Shapiro et al., 2009). Processes such as bacterial
cell cycle, motility and development are now understood
to depend upon the specific distribution of proteins within
the cytoplasm or within the membrane (Dworkin, 2009;
Shapiro et al., 2009; Rudner and Losick, 2010). These
specific cell locations are critical for bacterial cell physiol-
ogy. To further understand how these cellular locations
influence PVDI biosynthesis, we generated P. aeruginosa
mutant strains expressing, at native levels, proteins
involved in this process fused with either eYFP or
mCHERRY. We focused on PvdA, as one of the initial
enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway of PVDI in the cyto-
plasm, and PvdQ, as the best characterized protein
involved in the maturation of PVDI in the periplasm before
secretion. We showed that PvdA and PvdQ, which are
involved in two very distant steps in the PVDI biosynthetic
pathway, had completely different distributions within the
cell. Whereas PvdA was mainly located at the old cell

pole, PvdQ was uniformly distributed throughout the
periplasm.

Results

The PvdA C-terminal fusion is functional whereas the
N-terminal fusion is not

Our aim was to localize the PvdA enzyme in its intracel-
lular environment, when expressed at physiological
levels. We constructed suicide vectors containing DNA
encoding eYFP flanked by 700 bp upstream and down-
stream to the insertion sites. Insertion of these modified
regions by allelic exchange into wild-type PAO1 (Ye et al.,
1995) produced two strains expressing eYFP fused either
at the N-terminus (yfp-pvdA) or the C-terminus (pvdA-yfp)
of PvdA.

PVDI has a characteristic absorbance at 447 nm. We
thus monitored bacterial growth (by measuring the optical
density at 600 nm) and PVDI production (by measuring
the optical density at 400 nm) over time for PAO1,
PAO1pvdA, yfp-pvdA and pvdA-yfp in iron-depleted
minimal media (Fig. 1A). As previously reported, deletion
of the pvdA gene did not affect bacterial growth but did
abolish PVDI production (Visca et al., 1994; Ochsner
et al., 2002; Lamont and Martin, 2003). Concerning our
insertion mutants, pvdA-yfp synthesized PVDI at the
same level as wild-type PAO1, whereas expression of
PVDI was not detected in yfp-pvdA. We also tested the
ability of yfp-pvdA and pvdA-yfp to transport Pvd-55Fe
complexes. As expected, both of these strains transported
PVDI-55Fe complexes as efficiently as the PAO1 and the
PAO1pvdA deletion strains (data shown in Fig. S1A in
Supporting information for pvdA-yfp).

The PvdA C-terminal fusion is stable whereas the
N-terminal fusion is not expressed

To check the integrity of the PvdA fusion proteins, we
subjected whole-cell extracts from PAO1, PAO1pvdA, yfp-
pvdA and pvdA-yfp cultures to SDS-PAGE electrophore-
sis followed by Western blot analysis using anti-GFP
antibodies, which can detect all variants of Aequorea vic-
toria GFP. As expected, no eYFP signal was detected in
the PAO1 or the PAO1pvdA strains. A single band below
the 100 kDa marker band was detected in the cell extracts
from the pvdA-yfp strain (Fig. 2A). Because wild-type
PvdA migrates at an apparent mass of ~49 kDa (Imperi
et al., 2008), the band detected in the pvdA-yfp strain is
consistent with an insertion of the eYFP protein into PvdA,
which would generate an ~80 kDa PvdA-eYFP fusion
protein. In contrast, no eYFP was detected in the cell
extracts from the yfp-pvdA, indicating that no eYFP is
expressed in this N-terminal fusion strain. It is therefore

highly likely that the PAO1pvdA phenotype of yfp-pvdA is
due to the absence of the fusion protein eYFP-PvdA
rather than a defect in enzymatic activity.

PvdA is a membrane-associated protein located at the
old cell pole

pvdA-yfp strain was used to investigated the in vivo sub-
cellular location of PvdA using cell fractionation. We
analysed each fraction, exploiting the fluorescence of
eYFP to detect the PvdA fusion protein and the fluores-

cence of PVDI to assess the fractionation efficiency – as
PVDI is located in the periplasm (Greenwald et al., 2007;
Yeterian et al., 2010a). As a control, we checked that no
eYFP was detected in the cellular compartments of a
PAO1 strain. As shown in Fig. 2B, 82% of the total PVDI
fluorescence was detected in the periplasm of pvdA-yfp,
indicating a successful fractionation. In contrast, eYFP
was predominantly detected in the membrane fraction,
which contained 60% of the total eYFP fluorescences,
compared with 36% of the total eYFP fluorescence con-
tained in the cytoplasm. This is consistent with previous

Fig. 1. Effect of fusion proteins of eYFP with PvdA (A) and of
mCHERRY with PvdQ (B) on bacterial growth and PVDI
production. Bacteria were washed in iron-depleted succinate media
to remove iron from LB media. Fresh minimal media were then
inoculated with these bacteria and distributed into a 96-well plate.
The growth (solid lines in panels A and B) and PVDI production
(dashed lines in panels A and B) were monitored over time by
OD600 and OD400 measurements. Panel (A) presents the
measurements for PAO1 (red), PAO1pvdA (black), yfp-pvdA (pink),
and pvdA-yfp (blue) and panel (B) for PAO1 (red), PAO1pvdQ
(brown), mcherry-pvdQ (green), and pvdQ-mcherry (yellow). These
measurements were performed every 30 min in a Tecan microplate
reader with shaking and incubation at 30°C. Each curve represents
a mean derived from six replicates. PVDI production (OD400) at a
given time was normalized by the corresponding bacterial-growth
reading (OD600).

data shown represent the means of three independent
experiments.

reports that wild-type PvdA is mostly found associated
with membranes (Imperi et al., 2008).

We then assessed the in vivo protein location using
epifluorescence imaging of the pvdA-yfp strain grown in
minimal media. During the stationary phase, we found
that PvdA-YFP was mainly located on one pole of the
cells. It is therefore possible that the membrane-
associated PvdA-YFP formed a patch on the membrane,
whereas we observed that the cytoplasmic fraction of
PvdA-eYFP was uniformly distributed. We monitored the
evolution of the cells containing a fluorescence spot over
the unspotted cell throughout cell growth. Although no
spotted cells could be detected during the lag phase or at
the beginning of the exponential phase, we observed the
first patches of fluorescence during the mid-exponential
phase and the number of spotted PvdA-eYFP cells
increased until the stationary phase, when all of the cells
displayed a patched pattern (Fig. 3A). Lifetime imaging
showed that this patch of PvdA-YFP was located at the
old pole of the mother cell during division (Fig. 3B). As
expected, when PvdA-YFP was found to be uniformly
distributed throughout the cytoplasm, the protein
appeared to be equally distributed to the daughter cells
(Fig. 3C). In the presence of 10 mM PVDI-Fe, no fast
dissolution of the PvdA-YFP spots in pvdA-yfp cells was
observed. The spots only started to disappear after
completion of a cell cycle (Fig. 3D). In conclusion, PvdA-
YFP was mainly located in clusters at the old cell pole,
and exhibited a polar distribution following cell division,
whereas a subset of cells displayed a uniform distribution
of the fusion protein within the cytoplasm.

PvdQ N- and C-terminal fusions are fully active

We then focused on the PvdQ enzyme to gain insights
into the periplasmic maturation of PVDI. PvdQ belongs to
the superfamily of the N-terminal nucleophile hydrolases
(Ntn-hydrolases). Although proteins from this family
possess various enzymatic activities, all exhibit an auto-
proteolytic activation resulting in the formation of two
tightly bound chains (an a-subunit of 18 kDa that comes
from the N-terminal domain of the proenzyme and a
60 kDa b-chain) and the creation of an active site
(Oinonen and Rouvinen, 2000; Sio et al., 2006). To deter-
mine the subcellular location of PvdQ, we inserted DNA
encoding mCHERRY by allelic exchange to generate
mutant PAO1 strains expressing PvdQ with mCHERRY
fused at either the N-terminus (mcherry-pvdQ) or the
C-terminus (pvdQ-mcherry) of the protein. The insertion
site for the N-terminal fusion was placed at alanine 23,
which is downstream to the cleavage site of the signal
sequence (Sio et al., 2006). Corresponding mutator
vectors were constructed as described for the PvdA
mutant strains.

We monitored bacterial growth and PVDI production for
mcherry-pvdQ, pvdQ-mcherry, PAO1 and PAO1pvdQ
strains, when cultured in iron-deficient succinate media
(Fig. 1B). Every strain displayed similar growth profiles
and only the PAO1pvdQ strain did not produce PVDI as
described previously (Ochsner et al., 2002; Lamont and
Martin, 2003; Nadal Jimenez et al., 2010), indicating that
mCHERRY-PvdQ and PvdQ-mCHERRY retained wild-
type PvdQ activity for PVDI production. As expected, the
mcherry-pvdQ and pvdQ-mcherry mutant strains incorpo-
rated radiolabelled PVDI-Fe complex with the same effi-
ciency as the PAO1 and PAO1pvdQ strains (Fig. S1B in
Supporting information).

PvdQ has been recently shown to play a major role in
biofilm formation in iron-depleted media (Wang et al.,
2011). We tested the ability of the mcherry-pvdQ and
pvdQ-mcherry strains to form biofilm (Fig. S2 in Support-
ing information). Both strains produced about the same
amount of biofilm compared with the PAO1 strain, and
produced significantly more biofilm than the PAO1pvdQ
deletion mutant.

PvdQ N- and C-terminal fusions are stable and
mCHERRY is attached to the a- or b-subunit of
PvdQ respectively

We tested for the presence of the PvdQ-mCHERRY
fusion proteins by immunoblot analysis on whole-cell
extracts derived from PAO1, PAO1pvdQ, mcherry-pvdQ
and pvdQ-mcherry strains grown in iron-depleted minimal
media. Detection was performed using antibodies raised
against PvdQ (Fig. 4A) or DsRed (Fig. 4B), which recog-
nizes the mCHERRY protein. As expected, no signal for
anti-PvdQ antibodies was observed in the PAO1pvdQ
strain. In the extracts from the PAO1 strain, a single band
of ~60 kDa was detected, which corresponds to the
b-subunit of the PvdQ protein (Nadal Jimenez et al., 2010)
(Fig. 4A). This same band was also observed for mcherry-
pvdQ strain. A band of ~100 kDa was detected in the
extracts from pvdQ-mcherry, which is consistent with
the presence of an intact b-subunit of PvdQ fused to
mCHERRY (Fig. 4A). Immunoblotting using anti-DsRed
antibodies to detect mCHERRY yielded no signal in the
extracts from PAO1 and PAO1pvdQ. However, anti-
DsRed antibodies detected the same ~ 100 kDa band as
that detected by anti-PvdQ antibodies in extracts from the
pvdQ-mcherry strain, which corresponded to mCHERRY
fused with the b-subunit of PvdQ (Fig. 4B). By comparing
the signals for free mCHERRY (~ 30 kDa) and the
~ 50 kDa band detected in the mcherry-pvdQ strain, we
deduced that when the PvdQ protein is matured,
mCHERRY remains fused to the a-subunit (Fig. 4B). In
conclusion, the fully active fusion proteins that we
designed are mature in a similar manner to their wild-type

counterparts, and mCHERRY is fused with the a-subunit
of PvdQ in mCHERRY-PvdQ, and with the b-subunit of
PvdQ in PvdQ-mCHERRY.

Periplasmic PvdQ fusion proteins are uniformly
distributed within the periplasm

We performed cell-fractionation studies to confirm
the export of the fusion proteins to the periplasm.
mcherry-pvdQ and pvdQ-mcherry strains were cultured
in succinate media and cytoplasmic, periplasmic, and
membrane fractions were isolated. Very low levels of
PVDI were detected in the cytoplasm (~ 13% of the
total PVDI fluorescence), indicating that there was no
significant periplasmic contamination of the cytoplasmic
fractions (Fig. 4C and D). As expected from the PVDI-
production phenotypes for mCHERRY-PvdQ and PvdQ-
mCHERRY, most of the fluorescence for mCHERRY
(54% of the total fluorescence for mCHERRY for both
fusion proteins) was found in the periplasm (Fig. 4C
and D). Nevertheless, a high level of fluorescence for
mCHERRY (39% the total fluorescence for mCHERRY)
was also observed in the cytoplasmic fraction for both

fusion proteins. According to the cell fractionation of
PVDI, the presence of mCHERRY in the cytoplasmic
fractions is not due to periplasmic contamination. We
compared the distribution of PvdQ in the cytoplasm and
periplasm of the wild-type PAO1 strain with that of our
mutants by immunoblot analysis using an anti-PvdQ
antibody on the isolated cell compartments (Fig. S3 in
Supporting information). Although similar amounts of the
PvdQ b-chain were detected in both periplasmic and
cytoplasmic fractions, the band corresponding to the
PvdQ a-chain was detected in the periplasmic fraction
only. Thus, the PvdQ enzyme in the cytoplasm may cor-
respond to the uncleaved inactive form of the protein,
which has yet to be exported to the periplasm to com-
plete its full maturation. Finally, the distribution of PvdQ
in the cytoplasm and periplasm of the mcherry-pvdQ
and pvdQ-mcherry strains, was similar to that in the
PAO1 strain. N- and C-terminal fusion proteins of
mCHERRY and PvdQ therefore showed the same sub-
cellular distribution as wild-type PvdQ.

The periplasmic fluorescence distributions in mcherry-
pvdQ and pvdQ-mcherry strains were examined using
epifluorescence microscopy. mCHERRY imaging identi-

means of three independent experiments.

fied fluorescent halos, similar to the distribution detected
for periplasmic PVDI (Hannauer et al., 2010; Yeterian
et al., 2010a,b) (Fig. 5A and B). We also used Total Inter-
nal Reflection (TIRF) microscopy imaging (Fig. 5C and D),
in which the incident light is inclined so that only the cell
surface is illuminated. Considering the cell-fractionation
findings, the full cell surface displayed in TIRF mode
allowed us to visualize a uniform periplasmic localization
for both mCHERRY fusions. PvdQ, with mCHERRY fused
to either its a- or b-subunit, is therefore uniformly distrib-
uted throughout the periplasm.

Discussion

Bacteria are now understood to have a higher degree of
intracellular organization than previously thought. Indi-
vidual proteins are located at particular sites within the
bacterial cell and these distribution patterns are often
dynamic (Dworkin, 2009; Shapiro et al., 2009; Rudner
and Losick, 2010). PVDI biosynthesis is a multistep
process starting in the cytoplasm and ending in the peri-
plasm and involving at least 11 different proteins. The
activities of most of these are now well characterized.
However, the bacterial intracellular organization of the
sequential steps that lead to mature PVDI and their
orchestration in vivo remain unknown.

PvdA, a L-ornithine Nd-oxygenase, is one of the initial
enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway of PVDI in the cyto-

plasm (Visca et al., 1994; 2007). The N-terminal domain
of PvdA has been recently shown to have two overlapping
functional regions; an FAD-binding site and an inner
membrane anchoring hydrophobic domain (Imperi et al.,
2008; Meneely et al., 2009). In a wild-type context, PvdA
was only fully functional and intact when eYFP was fused
to its C-terminus. When we fused the N-terminus of PvdA
with eYFP, no PVDI was produced and immunoblot analy-
sis indicated there was likely no PvdA protein present in
the cells. For the C-terminal fusion protein, we found a
high content of eYFP in the membrane fraction after cel-
lular fractionation of the corresponding pvdA-yfp strain,
as previously reported for wild-type PvdA (Imperi et al.,
2008). Epifluorescence imaging revealed that the PvdA-
YFP fusion protein was not randomly distributed along the
inner membrane but instead appeared as a spot at one
cell pole. The asymmetric segregation of proteins has
been previously reported to be a marker of cellular aging
and rejuvenation in bacteria (Lindner et al., 2008).
However, such process is associated with irreversible
protein aggregation, whereas adding PVDI-Fe to bacteria
with PvdA-YFP clusters to reverse PVDI biosynthesis led
to the disappearance of clustered proteins (Fig. 3D).
Thus, the clustering of PvdA appears to be a dynamic
process and must involve other functional proteins. As
PvdA is involved in the complex sequential addition of
peptide building blocks to form a cytoplasmic non-
fluorescent PVDI precursor with a myristic acid chain, the

spotted localization of PvdA may reflect the need to com-
partmentalize this coordinated process in a crowded envi-
ronment such as the cytoplasm. Indeed, the PvdA patch
that we observed might also contain other enzymes
required for PVDI biosynthesis in the cytoplasm. The cyto-
plasmic precursor of PVDI with a myristic acid chain
(Gulick and Drake, 2011; Hannauer et al., 2012) would
therefore continually pass from one enzyme to another,
and never be free in the cytoplasm. This organization
would optimize the efficiency of the process by keeping
the PVDI precursor close to the membrane and avoiding
its dilution into the cytoplasm. Bacterial chemotaxis
signal transduction proteins are also organized as pro-
tein assembly patches composed of transmembrane
chemoreceptors and associated cytoplasmic proteins [for
a review, see (Sourjik, 2004)]. Using similar experimental
models to those used in our study (Martin et al., 2001;
Cantwell et al., 2003; Guvener et al., 2006), immunogold
electron microscopy (Harrison et al., 1999), and electron
tomography (Briegel et al., 2009), other authors have
identified a cluster of proteins located at the cell pole
allowing signal transduction from the periplasm to the
cytoplasm. As we observed with PvdA, these proteins are
not only present at the cell poles; a subset remains in the
cytoplasm and the number of spotted cells increases
during growth (Martin et al., 2001; Cantwell et al., 2003;
Guvener et al., 2006). PvdA promoter activity reaches a
peak during the mid-exponential phase, after which it
decreases (Putignani et al., 2004). This radical change in
PvdA promoter activity thus appears to coincide with the
moment we observe the switch from homogeneously dis-
tributed proteins to the appearance of patched proteins in
cells, and may in turn indicate how this conversion is
governed. The significance of the spotted bacterial cells
versus the unspotted cells remains unknown, but prob-
ably represents the different growing stages of individual
bacteria.

During cell division, we found that the clustered PvdA
did not relocate to both cell poles; the distribution to the
daughter cells was asymmetric, resulting in an old cell
pole location. Although asymmetrical division in bacteria
remains contentious, there are an increasing number of
examples appearing in the literature (for a review, see
Shapiro et al., 2002). Whereas genetic information is
equally distributed to the daughter cells, surface struc-
tures, such as flagella or pili, are preferentially associated
at one cell pole and are thus inherited by only one daugh-
ter cell. In the pathogenic bacteria Shigella flexneri and
Listeria monocytogenes, the old cell poles accumulate
proteins that promote interactions with the host (Goldberg
et al., 1993; Smith et al., 1995).

Finally, addition of 10 mM PVDI-Fe to pvdA-yfp cells did
not result in rapid dissolution of the PvdA-YFP spot; they
only started to disappear after a cell-division cycle. This

suggests that PVDI-Fe does not regulate the organization
of PvdA into spots.

PvdQ is a well-characterized Ntn-hydrolase that
removes the myristic chain linked to the precursor PVDI
before secretion (Lamont and Martin, 2003; Bokhove
et al., 2010; Nadal Jimenez et al., 2010; Gulick and
Drake, 2011). When transferred into PAO1 strains, the
N-terminal and C-terminal fusion proteins of PvdQ exhib-
ited the full enzymatic activity of PvdQ and produced
PVDI at wild-type levels. In contrast with the spotted loca-
tion of PvdA, PvdQ was uniformly distributed throughout
the periplasm. Fluorescent PVDI having no more myristic
chain is also detected all over the periplasm by epifluo-
rescence microscopy (Yeterian et al., 2010a). Mutation of
the efflux pump PvdRT-OpmQ involved in PVDI secretion
across the outer membrane, increases PVDI accumula-
tion in the bacterial periplasm (Hannauer et al., 2010).
Together all these data suggest a maturation of PVDI
homogeneously distributed throughout the periplasm.

In conclusion, our results suggest that the PVDI cyto-
plasmic precursor is synthesized through coordinated
enzymatic activities localized at the interface between
the cytoplasm and the inner membrane of the bacterial
old cell pole. This specific cellular localization probably
ensures the efficiency of this complex biosynthesis.
PvdQ, an enzyme involved in the periplasmic maturation
of PVDI, is homogeneously distributed throughout the
periplasm like fluorescent PVDI having no more myristic
chain (Yeterian et al., 2010a). This homogeneous distri-
bution of PVDI maturation all over the bacterial periplasm
probably ensures a secretion of the siderophore across
the outer membrane all over the bacterial periphery.
Further studies are required to confirm this model and to
identify the cell localization of the other enzymes involved
in this process.

Experimental procedures

Bacterial strains, plasmids and growth conditions

The P. aeruginosa and Escherichia coli strains and the plas-
mids used in this study are listed in Table 1. Bacteria were
usually grown in Luria broth [(LB); Difco] medium kept at
37°C. The P. aeruginosa strains were grown overnight at
30°C in an iron-deficient succinate medium (composition:
6 g l-1 K2HPO4, 3 g l-1 KH2PO4, 1 g l-1 [NH4]2SO4, 0.2 g l-1

MgSO4 7H2O and 4 g l-1 sodium succinate with the pH
adjusted to 7.0 by adding NaOH). The antibiotic, gentamicin
(50 mg ml-1), was added as required.

Mutant construction

All enzymes for DNA manipulation were purchased from Fer-
mentas and were used in accordance with the manufacturer’s
instructions. E. coli strain TOP10 (Invitrogen) was used as a

host strain for all plasmids. PCR, using iProof polymerase
(Bio-Rad), was used to amplify the genes encoding the fluo-
rescent proteins from the following cDNAs: pCDNA3.1/
mCHERRY for mCHERRY and pCDNA3.1/eYFP for eYFP.
The DNA fragments from Pseudomonas used for cloning
were amplified from the PAO1 genomic DNA. Primers used
are listed in Table S1 of Supporting information. The general
procedure consisted of cloning the pME3088 suicide vector
(Voisard et al., 1994) into a construct composed of the fluo-
rescent protein encoding DNA flanked by upstream and
downstream regions of 700 bp relative to the insertion site.
Mutations in the chromosomal genome of P. aeruginosa
were generated by transferring the suicide vectors from
E. coli S17-1 into the PAO1 strains and integration of the
plasmids into the chromosome, with selection for tetracycline
resistance. A second crossing-over event excising the vector
was achieved by enrichment for tetracycline-sensitive cells to
generate the corresponding mutants (Ye et al., 1995). All
gene-replacement mutants were verified by PCR.

PvdA labelled at the N-terminus with eYFP (YFP-PvdA)
was derived through three sets of PCRs. The 700 bp region
upstream to the PvdA gene, which contains the ATG start
codon, was amplified by the primers PvdA1 and PvdA2,
which inserted restriction sites for EcoRI and XbaI respec-
tively. The 700 bp downstream region was amplified by the
primers PvdA3 and PvdA4, which inserted restriction sites
for XhoI and HindIII respectively. The DNA encoding eYFP
was amplified by the primers YFP1 and YFP2, which
inserted restriction sites for XbaI and XhoI respectively. Fol-
lowing PCR, the amplified 700 bp upstream region was
digested by XbaI, the amplified 700 bp downstream region
was digested by XhoI, and the amplified DNA encoding
eYFP was digested by XbaI and XhoI. After their digestion,
all three of these PCR products were ligated in equimolar
amounts. The ligation product was used as a DNA template
for further amplification with the primers PvdA1 and PvdA4.
The PCR product was digested by EcoRI and HindIII,

ligated into pME3088, linearized by the same enzymes, to
produce pMEM1.

PvdA labelled at the C-terminus with eYFP (PvdA-YFP)
was also derived from three sets of PCRs. The 700 bp
region upstream relative to the stop codon was amplified by
the primers and PvdA6, which inserted restriction sites for
EcoRI and XbaI. The 700 bp downstream region containing
the stop codon was amplified with primers PvdA7 and
PvdA8, which inserted restriction sites for XhoI and HindIII
respectively. The eYFP-encoding DNA was amplified with
the primers YFP1 and YFP2, which inserted restriction sites
for XbaI and XhoI respectively. Following PCR, the amplified
700 bp upstream region was digested by XbaI, the amplified
700 bp downstream region was digested by XhoI, and the
amplified DNA encoding eYFP was digested by XbaI and
XhoI respectively. After their digestion, all three of these
PCR products were ligated in equimolar amounts. The liga-
tion product was used as a template for amplification by
primers PvdA5 and PvdA8, and the resulting PCR product
was digested by EcoRI and HindIII, cloned into pME3088,
linearized by the same enzymes to produce pMEM2.

PvdQ labelled at the N-terminus with mCHERRY
(mCHERRY-PvdQ) was derived from three sets of PCRs. The
700 bp upstream region containing the predicted protease I
cleavage site (amino acid A23) was amplified with the primers
PvdQ1, which inserting a restriction site for EcoRI, and
PvdQ2, which inserted a restriction site for XbaI. The 700 bp
downstream region starting from the codon of D24 was ampli-
fied with the primers PvdQ3, which inserted a restriction site
for SalI, and PvdQ4, which inserted a restriction for HindIII.
The DNA encoding mCHERRY was amplified with the
primers, mCHERRY1, which inserted a restriction site for
XbaI, and mCHERRY2, which inserted a restriction site for
SalI. Following PCR, the amplified 700 bp upstream region
was digested by XbaI, the amplified 700 bp downstream
region was digested by SalI, and the amplified DNA encoding
mCHERRY was digested by XbaI and SalI. After their diges-

tion, all three of these PCR products were ligated in equimo-
lar amounts. The ligation product was used as a DNA
template for further amplification with the primers PvdQ1 and
PvdQ4, and the resulting PCR product was digested by
EcoRI and HindIII, ligated into pME3088, linearized by the
same enzymes, to produce pLG1.

PvdQ labelled at the C-terminus with mCHERRY (PvdQ-
mCHERRY) was also derived from three sets of PCRs. The
700 bp region upstream to the TGA stop codon was amplified
using the primers PvdQ5, which inserted a restriction site for
EcoRI, and PvdQ6, which inserted a restriction site for and
XbaI. The downstream region containing the stop codon was
amplified with primers PvdQ7, which inserted a restriction site
for SalI, and primer PvdQ8, which inserted a restriction site
for HindIII. DNA encoding mCHERRY was amplified with the
primers mCHERRY1, which inserted a 3′ restriction site for
XbaI, and mCHERRY2, which inserted a 5′ restriction site for
SalI. Following PCR, the amplified 700 bp upstream region
was digested by XbaI, the amplified 700 bp downstream was
digested by SalI, and the amplified DNA encoding mCHERRY
was digested by ClaI and SalI. All three of these digested
PCR products were then ligated in equimolar amounts to
generate the DNA template for amplification with primers
PvdQ5 and PvdQ8. The resulting PCR product was digested
with EcoRI and HindIII, ligated into pME3088, and was then
linearized with the same enzymes to yield pLG2.

To generate a suicide vector for pvdA deletion in PAO1
(PAO1pvdA) strain, two regions of 700 bp upstream and
downstream of pvdA were generated by PCR using primers
PvdA1 and PvdA9, inserting EcoRI and XbaI restriction sites,
and PvdA10 and PvdA8, inserting XbaI and HindIII respec-
tively. The two fragments were digested by XbaI and ligated
to yield the DNA template for amplification with primers
PvdA1 and PvdA8. The PCR product was digested with
EcoRI and HindIII and ligated into pME3088, linearized with
the same enzymes, giving pLG3.

Growth and quantification of PVDI production

Cells were cultured overnight in LB media kept at 37°C. Cells
were pelleted and washed once with one volume of succinate
media and then resuspended to reach a final concentration of
0.1 OD600 ml-1. Two hundred microlitres of the suspension
were distributed into 96 well plates (Greiner, PS-microplate
flat bottom). Plates were then incubated at 30°C and agitated
in a Tecan microplate reader (Infinite M200, Tecan) for mea-
surements of OD600 and OD400 every 30 min over 35 h. Each
measurement represented a mean taken from six replicates.

Iron uptake assays

PVDI-55Fe (0.25 Ci mmol-1) was prepared as previously
described (Schalk et al., 2001), with a fourfold excess of
PVDI over iron. The uptake assays were carried out as
described previously (Schalk et al., 2001). An overnight
culture in iron-limited medium was harvested and the bacteria
prepared at an OD600 of 1 in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and
incubated at 37°C. Transport assays were initiated by adding
100 nM of PVDI-55Fe. Aliquots (100 ml) of the suspension
were removed at different times, filtered, washed with 3 ml

50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and the retained radioactivity was
counted. The experiment was repeated with cells that had
previously been treated with 200 mM carbonyl cyanide
m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), a protonophore that
inhibits iron uptake (Clément et al., 2004).

Biofilm quantification (Siroy et al., 2006)

Cells were cultured in LB media overnight at 37°C. Cells were
pelleted and washed once with one volume of succinate
media and were then resuspended to a final concentration of
0.05 OD600 ml-1. Three millilitres of the suspension were dis-
tributed in triplicate into a six-well plate (Greiner, TC-plate
CELLSTAR). Plates were then incubated at 30°C over 24 h
on a rocker shaker. For crystal-violet treatment, culture
supernatants were carefully removed, and the biofilm was
washed twice with sterile water. One millilitre of 0.5% crystal
violet was added and left in contact for 15 min at room tem-
perature with gentle agitation. After removal of the solution,
the biofilm was washed twice with sterile water before elution
of crystal violet by 1 ml of ethanol. The biofilm was then
quantified by measuring the absorbance at 570 nm of either
the directly eluted crystal violet or of an appropriate dilution
for accurate quantification.

Immunoblot analysis

We subjected 0.25 OD600 units of cells grown in succinate
media to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocel-
lulose membranes by electroblotting (Bio-Rad). The nitrocel-
lulose membranes were then blocked by incubation for 1 h in
blocking solution [phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.6,
10% dried milk powder] followed by incubation in blocking
buffer supplemented with primary anti-PvdQ antibodies
(1:1000 dilution), anti-GFP antibodies (1:10 000 dilution), or
anti-DsRed antibodies (1:100 dilution, Ozyme). Membranes
were then incubated in PBS (pH 7.6, 0.1% Tween) supple-
mented with a secondary antibody of IRDye 800CW donkey
anti-rabbit IgG (1:10 000 dilution, Clinisciences). Antibody
binding was detected with an Odyssey Imager (LI-COR
Biosciences).

Cell fractionation

Periplasm and cytoplasm fractions were prepared as previ-
ously described (Nader et al., 2011). Fifty millilitres of bacte-
rial cultures grown overnight in succinate medium were
centrifuged to obtain a cell pellet, which was washed twice
with 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and then resuspended in 1.5 ml
of buffer A (200 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20% sucrose). Sphero-
plasts were obtained by adding 15 ml of 100 mg ml-1
lysozyme (Euromedex) to the suspension and shaking the
mixture gently at 4°C for 1 h. The suspension was then cen-
trifuged (15 min at 6700 g) to obtain the spheroplast pellet
and the periplasmic fraction (the supernatant). Spheroplast
pellets were washed with 500 ml of buffer A, and resuspended
in 1.5 ml of cold water by vortexing; the resulting suspension
was incubated for 1 h at 37°C with benzonase (1 ml of a
50-fold dilution of benzonase � 250 units ml-1 from Sigma).
The cytoplasmic fractions were isolated by ultracentrifugation

(40 min at 120 000 g). Pellets were resuspended in about
1.5 ml of buffer A. Two hundred microlitres of each fraction
were distributed into a 96-well plate and the fluorescence was
measured in a Tecan microplate reader (Infinite M200, Tecan)
using the following excitation/emission wavelengths: 400 nm/
450 nm for PVDI, 514 nm/527 nm for eYFP, and 570 nm/
610 nm for mCHERRY.

Fluorescence microscopy imaging

Samples were prepared from strains cultured overnight in
succinate media. Cultures were washed by succinate media
and appropriately diluted in the same media. Five microlitres
of cell suspension were spotted on a glass slide that was
freshly coated with 1% agarose made in minimal media, and
covered with a coverslip. TIRF images were acquired with an
Observer.A1 (Zeiss) equipped with a Plan Fluar objective
(NA: 1.45, Zeiss) and a Cascade II 512 EMCCD camera
(photometrics). The imaging system was operated using
the software, VisiView 1.7.4 (Visitron Systems GmbH).
mCHERRY was excited by exposure to a laser of 561 nm
wavelength with a visitron VisiTIRF system. Fluorescence
signals were aquired using an appropriate filter cube. To
determine the pole location of the patched pvdA-yfp during
bacterial growth, cell division of the strain – grown twice in
succinate media during the exponential phase – was moni-
tored. Cells were spotted onto slides coated with agarose,
which was dissolved in succinate media. Cells were imaged
after 0, 1 and 2 h incubation periods at 30°C with a Nikon 50i
(objective: CFI Achroplan 100 ¥ A ON 1.25 DT 0.18) micro-
scope equipped with a numeric 12 bits DS-Fi1 camera. For
fluorescence imaging of eYFP, the filter GFP-3035B (excita-
tion 472 � 32 nm, emission 520 � 35 nm, dichroic filter 502–
730 nm) was used. Images were captured using the imaging
software, NIS elements. Images were minimally processed
with Image-JNIH software (Abramoff et al., 2004).

Fig. S1. Time-dependent uptake of PVDI-55Fe. Panel A rep-
resents the kinetics for PAO1 in the presence and absence of
CCCP (kinetics in orange and red respectively) and pvdA-yfp
(blue) in the absence of CCCP. Panel B represents the kinet-
ics for PAO1 in the presence and absence of CCCP (kinetics

in orange and red respectively), PAO1pvdQ (brown),
mcherry-pvdQ (green) and pvdQ-mcherry (yellow), all in the
absence of CCCP. Cells at an OD600 of 1 were incubated for
15 min at 37°C in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) before the initia-
tion of transport assays by the addition of 100 nM PVDI-55Fe.
Samples (100 ml) of the suspension were removed at various
times and filtered, and the radioactivity retained was counted.
The results are expressed as picomoles of PVDI-55Fe trans-
ported per millilitre of cells at an OD600 of 1. The experiment
was repeated with the protonophore CCCP at a concentration
of 200 mM (only the kinetics for PAO1 are represented).

6-well plates on a rocker shaker were stained by violet crystal
(A) and the quantity of crystal violet was evaluated by OD570
measurements upon elution by ethanol.

Abstract

We have already demonstrated that interferon alfa-2b (IFN-a2b) induces apoptosis in isolated hepatocytes from preneoplastic rat
livers via the secretion of transforming growth factor b1 (TGF-b1), and this process is accompanied by caspase-3 activation. The aim
of this study was to further investigate the mechanism of this activation. Isolated hepatocytes from preneoplastic livers induced DNA
fragmentation in response to IFN-a2b, which was completely blocked when anti-TGF-b1 was added to the culture media. IFN-a2b med-
iated radical oxygen species (ROS) production that preceded the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DW), release of cyto-
chrome c, and activation of caspase-3. Bax levels increased in a time-dependent fashion, and Bcl-xL was down-regulated in the early
hours of IFN-a2b treatment. The delayed translocation of Bid into the mitochondria was in concordance with late caspase-8 activation.
In conclusion, endogenous TGF-b1 secreted under IFN-a2b stimulus seems to induce cytochrome c release through a mechanism related
to Bcl-2 family members and loss of mitochondrial DW. Bax protein could be responsible of the release of cytochrome c during the initial
hours of IFN-a2b-induced apoptosis via TGF-b1. Activated Bid by caspases could amplificate the mitochondrial events, enhancing the
release of cytochrome c.

of solid tumors and hematological malignancies [1].
However, the benefit derived from IFN-a treatment of hepa-
tocarcinoma remains controversial [2]. In this regard, it has
been stated that IFN-a applied in the early stages of tumor
evolution could have a very important clinical effect, whereas
its activity in advanced stages would be minimal [3]. We have
previously shown that IFN-a2b induces apoptosis in isolated
hepatocytes from preneoplastic rat livers [4]. The apoptotic
effect of IFN-a2b was mediated by the production of
TGF-b1 from hepatocytes, due to the fact that when anti-
TGF-b1 was added to the culture media, IFN-a2b-induced
apoptosis was completely blocked.

Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is an essential
physiologic process required for normal development and
maintenance of liver homeostasis. However, apoptosis is

also involved in pathologic conditions, including liver
regression, physical and chemical liver injury, viral hepa-
titis, and liver carcinogenesis [5]. The aspartate-specific-
cysteine-protease (caspase) cascade is now believed to be
the main pathway by which cellular death is orchestrated
[6]. There are two pathways by which caspase activation is
triggered: the extrinsic and the intrinsic. Both pathways
converge on the activation of caspase-3. This caspase is
ultimately responsible for the majority of the effects [7].
The extrinsic pathway is activated by the engagement of
death receptors on the cell surface. Caspase-8 is the key
initiator caspase in the death-receptor pathway [8]. The
intrinsic pathway or non-receptor-mediated apoptosis is
triggered by various extracellular and intracellular stress-
es, such as growth factor withdrawal, hypoxia, DNA
damage, and oncogene induction. Signals that are trans-
duced in response to these stresses result in the permeabi-
lization of the outer mitochondrial membrane, release of
cytochrome c and other pro-apoptotic molecules, forma-
tion of the apoptosome, and caspase activation [9].
Among these processes, only the permeabilization step is
regulated, and several members of the Bcl-2 family are
involved in this regulation. The anti-apoptotic proteins
Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL can stop the march towards apoptotic
death by preventing cytochrome c release [10], whereas
translocation of pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax and Bid) to
the mitochondria can induce the release of cytochrome c
contained in the intermembrane space. Once cytochrome
c is released, the downstream cascade of caspase activa-
tion is irreversible [11].

The endogenous transforming growth factor b1 (TGF-
b1) is an important physiological mediator for apoptosis
in both normal and neoplastic liver [12]. It has been
reported that TGF-b1 plays an important role as an
inducer of apoptosis in a variety of cells, including pri-
mary hepatocytes [13], fetal rat hepatocytes [14], and
hepatoma cell lines [15–17]. Although the mechanisms
by which TGF-b1 induces apoptosis in hepatocytes have
not been fully elucidated, it is well established that TGF-
b1 mediates radical oxygen species (ROS) production
that contributes to the down-regulation of Bcl-xL, the
release of cytochrome c, and the activation of at least
caspases-2, -3, -8, and -9 [14–19]. However, the involve-
ment of Bcl-2, Bax, and Bcl-xL proteins in TGF-b1-in-
duced apoptosis has not been completely established.
TGF-b1 decreased the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL in
diverse hepatoma cell lines [16,20] whereas in other hep-
atoma cells no changes in Bax or Bcl-xL were observed
[17]. On the other hand, overexpression of Bcl-2 blocked
induction of apoptosis by TGF-b1 in human hepatoma
cells [21].

In the current study, we wished to further investigate the
mechanism of caspase activation during IFN-a2b-induced
apoptosis via TGF-b1. For this purpose, experiments were
performed to characterize the time-dependent effects of
IFN-a2b via TGF-b1 on hepatocytes from preneoplastic
livers.
2. Materials and methods

2.1. Chemicals

Diethylnitrosamine (DEN), 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-
AAF), 2 0,7 0-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA),
and collagenase were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co.
IFN-a2b was kindly provided by BioSidus Laboratory
(Buenos Aires, Argentina). Anti-caspase-3 (L-18), anti-cas-
pase-8 (H-134), anti-cytochrome c, anti-Bax, anti-Bcl-xL,
anti-Bid, and secondary antibodies were obtained from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The fluorogenic substrates for
caspase-3 N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-AMC (Ac-DEVD-
AMC) and for caspase-8 N-acetyl-Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-AMC
(Ac-IETD-AMC) were purchased from Alexis Co. Fluores-
cent probe tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM)
was from Fluka. All other chemicals were of the highest
grade commercially available.

2.2. Animals and treatment

Adult male Wistar rats (330–380 g) were maintained in a
room at constant temperature with a 12 h light–dark cycle,
with free access to food and water. The experimental pro-
tocol was performed according to the ‘‘Guide for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals’’ (National Institutes of
Health, publication no. 25–28, revised 1996). The animals
were subjected to a two-phase model of rat hepatocarcino-
genesis, for details see Ref. [22]. The initiation stage was
performed by the administration of two i.p. necrogenic
doses of DEN (150 mg/kg body weight) 2 weeks apart.
One week after the last injection of DEN, the rats received
20 mg/kg body weight of 2-AAF by gavage for four
consecutive days per week during 3 weeks.

2.3. Cell isolation and culture

Hepatocytes were isolated by collagenase perfusion and
mechanical disruption as described previously [23]. A hepa-
tocyte-enriched population from the entire liver containing
both preneoplastic hepatocytes plus hepatocytes from the
surrounding non-preneoplastic liver tissue was obtained
by centrifugation twice at 40 g [24]. To remove residual
adherent cells from the hepatocytes, the suspension was
incubated twice for 20 min in plastic dishes and the hepato-
cytes were transferred on culture plates.

Cells were cultured at 37 �C in a humidified atmosphere
of 5% CO2 in RPMI medium with L-glutamine supple-
mented with 10% FCS, penicillin (100 U/mL), and strepto-
mycin (100 lg/mL). Two hours later, the medium was
changed to fresh medium supplemented with 0.2% FCS,
and cells were treated with 105 U/mL IFN-a2b or left
untreated. This dose of IFN-a2b induced in vitro a similar
increment of hepatocytes apoptosis than the one observed
in vivo, when rats with preneoplasia received IFN-a2b at
therapeutic doses [22]. Cells were cultured at different
times: 1, 4, 7, 20, and 24 h.

The viability of all cell suspensions used, checked by
Trypan blue exclusion, was between 85% and 95%.

2.4. TGF-b1 assay

Hepatocyte-conditioned media were collected at the dif-
ferent times and TGF-b1 was quantitated using an ELISA
test (R&D Systems).

2.5. Analysis of apoptosis by DNA fragmentation

Hepatocytes cultured at different times were scrapped off
and centrifuged, lysed with 5 mmol/L Tris/HCl (pH 8.0),
20 mmol/L EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and stored at
4 �C for 15 min. Intact nuclei were eliminated by centrifu-
gation and the supernatant was centrifuged at 15,000g for
30 min at 4 �C. DNA in the supernatant was purified as
described previously [25]. Cytosolic DNA was subjected
to 10% PAGE. The gel was incubated for 30 min with
0.5 lg/mL ethidium bromide and visualized under trans-
mitted ultraviolet light by using the BioChemi System.

2.6. Analysis of apoptosis by annexin V staining

Apoptosis was investigated using the FITC-Annexin V
Apoptosis Kit (BD Biosciences). Cultured hepatocytes
were stained according to the manufacturer’s suggestions.
Then cells were washed, fixed, and viewed under fluores-
cence microscope. Apoptotic cells were counted by examin-
ing >1000 cells/dish and expressed per 100 hepatocytes.

2.7. Measurement of intracellular ROS

Formation of ROS was determined as previously
described [26,27], with slight modifications. Cells cultured
at different times were loaded with 5 lM DCFH-DA for
20 min at 37 �C with 5% CO2. Fluorescence was measured
on a Shimadzu Spectrofluorophotometer RF-5301 PC
(excitation wavelength 488 nm, emission wavelength
525 nm).

2.8. Preparation of mitochondria-enriched fractions and

cytosolic extracts

Hepatocytes were scrapped off the plates, and centri-
fuged, washed, and resuspended in 300 mmol/L sucrose
with protease inhibitors. Cells were disrupted by sonication
and incubated at 4 �C for 15 min and lysates were centri-
fuged at 1000g. Mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions were
then produced as described by de Duve et al. [28]. Proteins
were quantified according to Lowry et al. [29]. Enrichment
of each cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions was deter-
mined by the measurement of specific activities of succinate
cytochrome c reductase (mitochondrial marker) and lactate
dehydrogenase (cytosolic marker) [30]. The specific activity
of lactate dehydrogenase in cytosol was 9 ± 2-fold higher
than in the mitochondrial fraction, whereas the specific
activity of succinate cytochrome c reductase in mitochon-
dria was 17 ± 2-fold higher than in cytosol.

2.9. Analysis of caspases-3 and -8 activities

Caspases-3 and -8 activities were evaluated by measur-
ing the proteolytic cleavage of their fluorogenic substrates
Ac-DEVD-AMC and Ac-IETD-AMC, respectively,
according to the manufacturer’s suggestions. Briefly, cyto-
solic extract (50 lg of protein) was added into reaction
buffer containing 20 mmol/L Hepes (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol,
2 mmol/L DTT, and 200 lmol/L caspase substrate. The
reaction mixture was incubated at 37 �C for 1 h. After that
time, enzymatic activity was measured in a luminescence
spectrometer (Aminco-Bowman Series 2) (excitation
wavelength 380 nm, emission wavelength 460 nm).

2.10. Western blot analysis

Procaspases-3 and -8 were detected in cytosolic extracts
(20 lg per lane), cytochrome c was analyzed in mitochon-
drial and cytosolic fractions (5 lg protein/condition).
Bax, Bcl-xL, and Bid were explored in mitochondria-en-
riched fractions (30 lg protein for Bax and Bcl-xL, and
15 lg for Bid). Samples were resolved by SDS–PAGE
and electroblotted onto polyvinyl difluoride membranes.
Immunoblots were blocked and incubated overnight at
4 �C with the primary antibody (1:500). Finally, they were
incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody
(1:5000) and bands were detected by ECL detection system
(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The immunoreactive
bands were quantified using the Gel-Pro Analyzer (Media
Cybernetics) software. In all Western blotting analysis,
the uniformity of protein loading was checked using
Ponceau S.

2.11. Analysis of mitochondrial transmembrane potential

To examine mitochondrial DW, cultured hepatocytes
were loaded with TMRM, a membrane-permeable cationic
fluorophore that accumulates in mitochondria in propor-
tion to their DW [31]. DW was determined by using a ratio
fluorescence approach [32].

2.12. Statistical analysis

The results were expressed as means ± SE. Significance
in differences was tested by one-way ANOVA, followed
by Tukey test. Differences were considered significant when
the p value was < 0.05.

3. Results

Cultured hepatocytes from preneoplastic rat livers did
not show increased levels of secreted TGF-b1 when they

were stimulated with IFN-a2b at 1 and 4 h of culture.
However, IFN-a2b presence in the culture media induced
a twofold increase of TGF-b1 secretion at 7 h of culture.
TGF-b1 levels continued significantly increased at 20 and
24 h of culture (Fig. 1).

3.2. DNA fragmentation analysis

According to other authors [25], only cytosolic, frag-
mented DNA was isolated, due to the fact that in total
DNA isolation experiments it was difficult to observe the
typical oligosomal ladder.

A representative time dependence study of the cell death
process is shown in Fig. 2a. Cultured hepatocytes did not
show DNA ladder after 1 and 4 h of IFN-a2b stimulus.
A very small amount of low molecular weight DNA frag-
mentation was first observed at 7 h of incubation with
IFN-a2b, and continuously increased for the next studied
hours, reaching a maximum at 24 h of culture. In contrast,
fragmented DNA was not observed in cultured cells that
were left untreated at all studied times (data not shown).
Fig. 2. Effect of IFN-a2b on DNA fragmentation. Hepatocytes from
preneoplastic livers were incubated for 1, 4, 7, 20, and 24 h without (not
shown) and with IFN-a2b (a), and also with IFN-a2b plus anti-TGF-b1
(b). Cells were lysed and subjected to cytoplasmic DNA extraction.
Purified low molecular weight DNA was electrophoresed on 10%
polyacrylamide gel and visualized by ultraviolet fluorescence by staining
with ethidium bromide. A representative experiment is shown.
In addition, experiments were performed with IFN-a2b
plus anti-TGF-b1 to demonstrate whether the DNA frag-
mentation observed in IFN-a2b-treated cells is mediated
by the production of TGF-b1 from hepatocytes. When
anti-TGF-b1 was added to the culture media, no DNA
cleavage was detected (Fig. 2b).

3.3. Annexin V staining analysis

Table 1 shows the percentage of apoptotic hepatocytes
by annexin V staining at the different hours of culture.
The percentage of apoptotic cells in IFN-a2b-treated cul-
tures significantly increased over unstimulated cultures at
20 and 24 h. When anti-TGF-b1 was added to the culture
media, no increase in the percentage of apoptotic hepato-
cytes could be detected.

3.4. ROS production analysis

It has been described that TGF-b1-induced apoptosis in
rat fetal hepatocytes is mediated by ROS production [25].
In this work, we examined whether the generation of
ROS is involved in the IFN-a2b-induced apoptotic cell
death of hepatocytes from rat preneoplastic livers. For this
purpose, we used DCFH-DA, an oxidation-sensitive fluo-
rescent probe [27]. Cells were incubated at different times
(0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 7, 20, and 24 h) with or without IFN-
a2b. Hepatocytes stimulated with this cytokine showed a
maximum increase in ROS production at 1 h of culture
(Fig. 3). After this time, ROS decreased, returning to con-
trol values. The presence of anti-TGF-b1 did not affect the
peak of ROS observed at 1 h of culture.

3.5. Caspases-3 and -8 activation analysis

In this work, time-course experiments to analyse the
activities of caspases-3 and -8, and the expressions of
procaspases-3 and -8 following IFN-a2b treatment were
performed. These procaspases are converted into active
subunits during the course of activation [16]. Thus,
decreases in densities of procaspase-3 or -8 bands indicate
activation of the respective caspase.

Hepatocytes from preneoplastic livers were cultured for different times
(0.5, 1, 1.5, 3, 4, 7, 20, and 24 h) in the absence or presence of IFN-a2b.
The production of ROS was analyzed as described in Section 2. Results

(untreated) cells and are means ± SE from at least four independent
experiments. *p < 0.05 vs. untreated cells.

Figs. 4a and b show that caspase-3 like and caspase-8
activities significantly increased at 24 h of culture under
IFN-a2b stimulus (40% and 85%, respectively, compared
with untreated cells). Before this time, no increase in casp-
ases-3 and -8 activities could be detected. According to
these results, procaspase-3 and procaspase-8 levels signifi-
cantly decreased after 24 h of IFN-a2b treatment (Figs.
4c and d). Besides, immunoblotting studies showed that

procaspase-8 levels. Hepatocytes were untreated (�) or treated (+) with IFN-
procaspase-3 levels started to diminish at 20 h of culture
in presence of IFN-a2b, whereas procaspase-8 levels start-
ed to decrease at 7 h of stimulation with IFN-a2b,
although these decreases were not statistically significant.
On the other hand, no changes in procaspase-3 or
procaspase-8 protein levels were observed in unstimulated
cultured hepatocytes from preneoplastic livers (Figs. 4c
and d).

These data showed that caspases-3 and -8 were pro-
cessed and activated during IFN-a2b-induced apoptosis
via TGF-b1. However, there was no clear evidence if one
caspase is being activated before the other.
3.6. Release of cytochrome c and mitochondrial

transmembrane potential analysis

We studied the intracellular distribution of cytochrome
c in IFN-a2b-stimulated hepatocytes from preneoplastic
livers. As early as 4 h after treating with IFN-a2b, there
was a significant increase in the cytochrome c content of
the cytosol and its levels increased over time, reaching a
maximum at 20 h. At the same time, cytochrome c content
decreased in the mitochondria. These results showed that
the release of the cytochrome c was an early cellular
response to TGF-b1 (Figs. 5a and b).

The disruption of mitochondrial transmembrane poten-
tial (DW) has been defined as an early irreversible stage of
apoptosis, preceding caspase-3 activation [10]. In agree-
ment with results previously reported for adult and fetal
rat hepatocytes [33,34], in this work we presented evidence
that the loss of mitochondrial DW was coincident with the
-a2b-induced apoptosis in hepatocytes from rat preneoplastic livers. Time

lts are expressed as percent values as means ± SE from three independent

3.7. Analysis of the Bcl-2 family proteins expression

The Bcl-2 family of proteins is related to the mitochon-
drial changes during apoptosis. Bax and Bcl-xL involve-
ment in TGF-b1-induced programmed cell death is
controversial [16,17,20]. So, we analyzed Bax and Bcl-xL
mitochondrial content in hepatocytes from preneoplastic
livers. Results showed that the levels of Bax increased in
mitochondria of hepatocytes after 4 h of IFN-a2b treat-
ment (30% compared with untreated cells) and augmented
in a time-dependent manner, reaching a maximum at 20 h
of culture (95% of increase with respect to unstimulated
cells) (Fig. 6a). It is well known that IFN-a induces apop-
tosis in different tumor cell lines through the activation of
pro-apoptotic Bax [35], so we have included Bax activation
studies in cultured cells treated with IFN-a2b and anti-
TGF-b1 in order to discard a possible induction of Bax
by IFN-a2b itself. The results indicated that the presence
of anti-TGF-b1 in the culture media of IFN-a2b-stimulated
hepatocytes completely blocked the increase of mitochon-
drial Bax protein levels at the studied times (data not

shown). So, Bax up-regulation in IFN-a2b-treated cells is
mediated by the TGF-b1 secreted from hepatocytes.

On the other hand, Bcl-xL mitochondrial content was
decreased in IFN-a2b-stimulated cells already at 1 h of
treatment (30% compared with untreated cells), and reached
a diminution of 50% at 7 h (Fig. 6a). This down-regulation of
Bcl-xL in the early hours of apoptosis, although no signifi-
cant during the time-course study, is in agreement with pre-
vious reports [14,16]. Moreover, Bax/Bcl-xL expression ratio
was calculated from the densitometric analysis of Western
blots; the ratio clearly increased during the studied times:
1.5 ± 0.1, 1.6 ± 0.2, 2.7 ± 0.3, 3.5 ± 0.4, and 3.3 ± 0.3, at
1, 4, 7, 20, and 24 h, respectively.

We also examined the mitochondrial levels of pro-apop-
totic protein Bid. Caspase-8-mediated cleavage of Bid
greatly increases its pro-death activity and results in trans-
location to mitochondria, where promotes cytochrome c
release [35]. Fig. 6b shows that truncated Bid increased in
mitochondria after 20 h of culture. As expected, this
delayed translocation of Bid protein was in concordance
with a late caspase-8 activation.

4. Discussion

Dysregulation of apoptosis has been implicated in
numerous pathological conditions, including cancer, auto-
immune disorders, viral infections, and others [5,7]. Efforts
aimed at treating these diseases by manipulating cell suicide
would seem to have great potential, although they are at a
relatively early stage.

In a previous work [4], we showed that IFN-a2b-in-
duced production of TGF-b1 by hepatocytes from preneo-
plastic livers is involved in the apoptotic elimination of
preneoplastic foci. In vitro studies revealed enhanced apop-
tosis of IFN-a2b-treated hepatocytes at 24 h of culture,
and this effect was mediated by hepatocytic TGF-b1.
Therefore, we investigated the mechanisms of IFN-a2b-in-
duced apoptosis via TGF-b1 in isolated hepatocytes from
preneoplastic rat livers by exploring some critical factors
involved in the apoptotic pathway.

The present work was made on a mixed population of
hepatocytes (preneoplastic plus surrounding cells).
Although we were unable to separate both populations,
the study of the apoptotic phenomenon induced by IFN-
a2b in the whole preneoplastic liver is of great interest, due
to the fact that patients with liver diseases treated with this
cytokine, such as chronic hepatitis B or C, may already have
small, clinically undetectable preneoplastic foci during
therapy.

The induction of apoptosis by IFN-a2b was determined
by annexin V staining. As previously reported [4], the per-
centage of apoptotic hepatocytes in IFN-a2b-treated cul-
tures increased twofold over unstimulated cultures at
24 h. The same increase was also observed at 20 h of
IFN-a2b stimulus. In accordance, the analysis of DNA
fragmentation showed a maximal increase of cytosolic
DNA at 24 h of culture. The addition of anti-TGF-b1
blocked hepatocytes apoptosis, with no increase in DNA
fragmentation and percentages of apoptotic hepatocytes,
similar to those in unstimulated cultures.

Reactive oxygen intermediates, such as hydrogen perox-
ides or oxygen radicals, are integral control elements in the
cell’s decision to enter apoptosis. IFN-a2b-mediated apop-
tosis via TGF-b1 in hepatocytes from preneoplastic livers
was preceded by an enhancement of ROS production. An
early ROS production induced by TGF-b1 has been previ-
ously described in fetal rat hepatocytes [14,34]. However, in
the present study the maximum increase in ROS at 1 h after
IFN-a2b treatment was not coincident with the highest
concentration of TGF-b1 in conditioned media detected
after 7 h of treatment. Moreover, the peak of ROS at 1 h
was not affected by the presence of anti-TGF-b1 in the cul-
ture media. In consequence, the increase of ROS might be
mediated by IFN-a2b but not by TGF-b1. It has been
shown that IFN-c induces ROS generation via upregula-
tion of NADPH oxidase, a ROS-producing system [37].
The same mechanism has been described to be activated
by IFN-a in human neutrophils [38]. So, it is possible that
in our model IFN-a2b could be raising ROS levels by
NADPH oxidase induction. Moreover, further work with
scavengers of reactive species is in process to provide
direct evidence that the generation of ROS is involved in
the IFN-a2b-induced apoptosis.

In the current study, we observed that caspases-3 and -
8 were activated in IFN-a2b-treated hepatocytes from pre-
neoplastic livers. Previous studies have indicated that acti-
vation of caspase-8 precedes the activation of caspase-3 in
TGF-b1-induced apoptosis in hepatoma cells [16]. Howev-
er, we were unable to define an ordered and sequential
processing of individual caspases. On the other hand,
Scaffidi et al. [39] previously reported that in some types
of cells such as liver cells there is a minimal amount of
receptor-activated caspase-8 and probably insufficient to
induce downstream effector caspase cleavage. This low
caspase-8 activity is thought not to be usually detected
but to be enough to cleave Bid. Truncated Bid then trans-
locates to the mitochondria where initiates mitochondria-
dependent apoptotic signals including cytochrome c
release and efficient activation of both caspases-8 and -3.
In view of the fact that procaspase-8 levels started to
decrease at 7 h of IFN-a2b treatment, we studied Bid pro-
tein mitochondrial levels. The delayed translocation of Bid
to the mitochondria (after 20 h of culture, see Fig. 6b)
allowed us to ascertain that the mechanism postulated
by Scaffidi et al. [39] is unlikely to contribute significantly
to the apoptotic effect of IFN-a2b on hepatocytes from
preneoplastic livers.

In the present study, Bax increased in a time-dependent
fashion, and Bcl-xL was down-regulated in the early hours
of IFN-a2b treatment. Therefore, the relative ratio
increased during the studied times, clearly favoring the
apoptotic process. It has been reported that TGF-b1 can
down-regulate Bcl-xL protein levels in some hepatoma cells
[16,20] and fetal rat hepatocytes [18] without affecting Bax

expression. Therefore, to our knowledge, this is the first
study where TGF-b1 induced mitochondrial Bax overex-
pression in hepatic cells.

We have also shown that cytochrome c is early released
into the cytoplasm in the time course of TGF-b1-induced
apoptosis (Fig. 5). This suggested that an apoptosome-
like-caspase-activation mechanism could be involved. The
exact mechanism by which cytochrome c is released from
the mitochondria during the apoptosis has not been eluci-
dated. Current ideas suggest that Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL prevent
the release of cytochrome c and, therefore, suppress apop-
tosis, whereas Bax and cleaved Bid promotes cytochrome c
release and apoptotic cell death [9,40]. In our study, the
release of cytochrome c into the cytosol was coincident
with the increase of Bax protein levels in mitochondria.
These data are in good agreement with previous observa-
tions that Bax protein can directly induce the release of
cytochrome c, without apparent requirement for caspases
[41]. On the other hand, it has been reported that Bid is
a much more potent cytochrome c-releasing factor than
Bax [36]. In accordance with this, the maximal levels of
cytochrome c found in cytosol at 20 h were corresponded
with augmented levels of Bid protein in mitochondria.

In conclusion, IFN-a2b treatment of hepatocytes from
preneoplastic rat livers produced an increase in ROS and
TGF-b1 secretion. This growth factor seems to induce cyto-
chrome c release through a mechanism related to Bcl-2
family members. Bax protein could be responsible of the
release of cytochrome c during the initial hours of IFN-
a2b-induced apoptosis via TGF-b1, whereas at later times
(after 20 h of culture) activation of Bid by caspases could
amplificate the mitochondrial events, enhancing the release
of cytochrome c.

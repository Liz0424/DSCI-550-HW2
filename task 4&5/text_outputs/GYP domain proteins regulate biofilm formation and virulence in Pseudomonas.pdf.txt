Summary

HD-GYP is a protein domain involved in the hydroly-
sis of the bacterial second messenger cyclic-di-GMP.
The genome of the human pathogen Pseudomonas
aeruginosa PAO1 encodes two proteins (PA4108,
PA4781) with an HD-GYP domain and a third protein,
PA2572, which contains a domain with variant key
residues (YN-GYP). Here we have investigated the
role of these proteins in biofilm formation, virulence
factor synthesis and virulence of P. aeruginosa. Muta-
tion of PA4108 and PA4781 led to an increase in the
level of cyclic-di-GMP in P. aeruginosa, consistent
with the predicted activity of the encoded proteins as
cyclic-di-GMP phosphodiesterases. Mutation of both
genes led to reduced swarming motility but had dif-
fering effects on production of the virulence factors
pyocyanin, pyoverdin and ExoS. Mutation of PA2572
had no effect on cyclic-di-GMP levels and did not
influence swarming motility. However, PA2572 had a
negative influence on swarming that was cryptic and
was revealed only after removal of an uncharacter-
ized C-terminal domain. Mutation of PA4108, PA4781
and PA2572 had distinct effects on biofilm formation
and architecture of P. aeruginosa. All three proteins
contributed to virulence of P. aeruginosa to larvae of
the Greater Wax moth Galleria mellonella.

Introduction

The nucleotide cyclic di-GMP [bis-(3′-5′)-cyclic di-
guanosine monophosphate] is a second messenger in
bacteria that regulates a range of functions including

developmental transitions, polysaccharide synthesis,
adhesion, biofilm formation, the synthesis of virulence
factors and virulence in bacterial pathogens (Römling
et al., 2005; Jenal and Malone, 2006; Ryan et al., 2006a;
Cotter and Stibitz, 2007). The level of cyclic di-GMP in
bacterial cells is influenced by both synthesis and degra-
dation. The GGDEF protein domain synthesizes cyclic
di-GMP, whereas EAL and HD-GYP domains are involved
in cyclic di-GMP hydrolysis (Paul et al., 2004; Christen
et al., 2005; Ryjenkov et al., 2005; Schmidt et al., 2005;
Tamayo et al., 2005; Ryan et al., 2006b). GGDEF and
EAL domains were first linked to cyclic di-GMP turnover
through studies of the regulation of cellulose synthesis in
Gluconacetobacter xylinus (Tal et al., 1998). Subse-
quently, a number of reports have described the role of
GGDEF/EAL domain proteins in the control of different
cellular functions in diverse bacteria and the enzymatic
activity of the two domains has been established. In con-
trast, comparatively little is known about the role of
HD-GYP domain proteins in bacteria, although bioinfor-
matic studies indicate that genes encoding proteins with
this domain occur in many genomic sequences represent-
ing all major classes of bacteria (Galperin, 2005).

Studies of the function and role of the HD-GYP domain
have thus far focused on the regulatory protein RpfG from
the plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris. RpfG is
required for full virulence of X. campestris and acts to
positively regulate the synthesis of virulence factors such
as extracellular enzymes and extracellular polysaccha-
ride, positively regulate motility, but negatively regulate
adherence and biofilm formation (Slater et al., 2000; Dow
et al., 2003; Crossman and Dow, 2004; Dow et al., 2006;
Ryan et al., 2007). The isolated HD-GYP domain of RpfG
can hydrolyse cyclic di-GMP to GMP via a linear interme-
diate (Ryan et al., 2006b). Mutation of the HD residues
comprising the presumed catalytic diad of the HD-GYP
domain abolishes both the regulatory activity and enzy-
matic activity against cyclic di-GMP (Ryan et al., 2006b).

The work in this paper had the overall aim of broaden-
ing our understanding of the cellular function of HD-GYP
domain proteins by examination of their role in the human
pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The P. aeruginosa
genome encodes two proteins (PA4108, PA4781) with an
HD-GYP domain and a third protein PA2572, which con-
tains a variant HD-GYP domain (specifically YN-GYP). It
is not known whether all three proteins are capable of

cyclic di-GMP degradation. The expression of PA4108,
PA4781 and PA2572 is substantially increased during
co-culture of P. aeruginosa with human epithelial cells
(Ichikawa et al., 2000; Chugani and Greenberg, 2007)
and PA2572 and PA4781 are induced by mucopurulent
fluid from cystic fibrosis patients (Wolfgang et al., 2004).
These observations raise the question as to whether
these proteins act to regulate factors associated with the
virulence of P. aeruginosa, an issue we address here. Our
findings indicate that PA4108 and PA4781 are cyclic
di-GMP phosphodiesterases that regulate the synthesis
and/or secretion of the virulence determinants pyocyanin,
pyoverdin and ExoS as well as having a positive effect on
swarming. In contrast, PA2572, which is inactive in cyclic
di-GMP hydrolysis, has a cryptic negative influence on
swarming. Mutations of PA4108, PA4781 and PA2572
have distinct effects on the synthesis of different virulence
determinants and on biofilm formation and architecture
but all mutants have reduced virulence to larvae of the
Greater Wax Moth Galleria mellonella.

Results

Domain organization of PA2572, PA4108 and PA4781

The HD-GYP domain in PA2572 and PA4781 is found
in association with an N-terminal CheY-like response
receiver (REC) regulatory domain. PA2572 additionally
has an uncharacterized C-terminal extension that is
absent from PA4781 and from RpfG of X. campestris.
PA4108 has an HD-GYP domain with additional
N-terminal and C-terminal domains that are uncharacter-
ized. The presence of the REC domain suggests that
PA2572 and PA4781 are elements within two component
regulatory systems. Although PA2572 is adjacent to a
gene (PA2571) encoding a sensor kinase, no gene encod-
ing a sensor kinase is found within the genomic vicinity of
PA4781, which appears therefore to be an ‘orphan’
regulator.

Analysis of the enzymatic activities of the HD-GYP
domains of PA2572, PA4108 and PA4781 by expression
in Xanthomonas campestris

As outlined in Introduction, mutation of rpfG in X. campes-
tris leads to a substantial reduction in the synthesis of the
extracellular enzymes endoglucanase, endomannanase
and protease. Expression of the isolated HD-GYP domain
of RpfG in the rpfG mutant background restores enzyme
production to near wild-type levels. This effect, which is
also seen with this domain carrying a C-terminal His6 tag,
depends upon the HD diad and the ability to degrade
cyclic di-GMP (Ryan et al., 2006b). Expression in the

X. campestris rpfG mutant was used to analyse the enzy-
matic activities of the isolated HD-GYP domains of
PA2572, PA4108 and PA4781 that had C-terminal His6
tags. HD-GYP domains from both PA4108 and PA4781
were able to restore production of endoglucanase,
endomannanase and protease towards wild-type levels
(Fig. 1A–C). In contrast, no effect was seen with the
YN-GYP domain of PA2572 (Fig. 1A–C). Western analy-
sis with antisera against the His6 tag showed that all the
domains were expressed (Fig. 1D).

The effects of expression of the various HD-GYP
domains on the cellular level of cyclic di-GMP in
X. campestris were also determined. The levels of the
nucleotide were elevated in the rpfG mutant compared
with the wild-type X. campestris strain 8004 (Fig. 2;
Fig. S1). Expression of the HD-GYP domains of RpfG,
PA4108 and PA4781 caused a reduction in the level,
although expression of the YN-GYP domain of PA2572
had no effect (Fig. 2). The absence of any effect with the
YN-GYP variant domain suggested that this does not
have any enzymatic activity against cyclic di-GMP. This
contention was further examined by assessment of the
effects of alteration of the conserved H231 and D232
residues of RpfG to Y and N residues respectively. These
changes (H231Y, D232N) were introduced by site-
directed mutagenic PCR into the construct expressing
HD-GYPHis6 (see Experimental procedures). Western
analysis with antisera against the His6 tag showed that
the variant protein was expressed to the same level as the
wild-type (Fig. S2). However, these alterations in the HD
diad eliminated the regulatory activity of the HD-GYPHis6
domain in restoring extracellular enzyme synthesis
(Fig. S2).

Taken together, these findings suggest that the
HD-GYP domains of PA4108 and PA4781 have cyclic
di-GMP phosphodiesterase activity but that the YN-GYP
domain of PA2572 is inactive. Unfortunately, it was not
possible to purify sufficient protein to examine these pro-
posed enzymatic activities directly.

Phenotypic effects of mutation of genes encoding
HD-GYP domain proteins in Pseudomonas aeruginosa

Specific disruption of PA2572, PA4108 and PA4781 was
carried out using pEX18-Gm as described in Experimen-
tal procedures. The mutant strains were tested for the
cellular level of cyclic di-GMP and for production of factors
or phenotypes that have been associated with P. aerugi-
nosa virulence. Mutation of PA2572, PA4108 and PA4781
had no effect on growth in minimal M9 medium or
complex LB medium. Mutation of PA4108 and PA4781
gave rise to increased levels of cyclic di-GMP (Fig. 3),
consistent with the role of the HD-GYP domain in cyclic
di-GMP degradation. In contrast, there was no discernible

difference in the level of cyclic di-GMP between the
PA2572 mutant and the wild-type (Fig. 3). Introduction of
the PA4108 and PA4781 genes cloned in pBBRMCS1-Cm
into the appropriate mutants reduced cyclic di-GMP levels
to wild-type (Fig. 3).

Mutation of PA4108 and PA4781 led to reduction in both
swarming and twitching motility (Fig. 4C and data not
shown), whereas mutation of PA2572 had no effect on
either form of motility. All strains showed wild-type swim-
ming motility. Introduction of PA4108 and PA4781 genes
into the appropriate mutants restored wild-type swarming
and twitching motility (Fig. 4C and data not shown).

Mutation of PA4108, PA4781 and PA2572 had different
effects on the production of the phenazine, pyocyanin, the
siderophore pyoverdine and rhamnolipid (Fig. 4; Fig. S3).
Mutation of PA4781 led to an increase in pyoverdine

production, whereas mutation of PA2572 led to a reduc-
tion and mutation of PA4108 had no significant effect
(Fig. 4A). In contrast, only mutation of PA4108 had a
significant effect on pyocyanin production, which was
reduced compared with wild-type (Fig. 4B). The produc-
tion of rhamnolipid was elevated in the PA2572 mutant but
was at wild-type level in both the PA4108 and PA4781
mutant strains (Fig. S3). Mutation of PA4108 but not
PA2572 or PA4781 led to reduction in the extracellular
levels of the Type III-secreted effector ExoS (Fig. 5A).
Introduction of the cloned PA4108 into the PA4108 mutant
restored ExoS levels to wild-type (Fig. 5B). Overall, these
results indicated that PA2572, PA4108 and PA4781 have
distinct regulatory effects on production of certain viru-
lence factors in P. aeruginosa, although PA4108 and
PA4781 have the same influence on motility.

Mutations of genes encoding different HD-GYP domain
proteins have distinct effects on biofilm formation in
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

The effect of mutation of PA4108, PA4781 and PA2572 on
biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa was assessed using
bacteria growing in flow cells (see Experimental proce-
dures). In FAB medium, wild-type P. aeruginosa devel-
oped characteristic mushroom structures with a stalk and
cap (Fig. 6A). The PA2572 mutant formed similar struc-
tures, but unlike the wild-type, had central hollowing of the
stalk with a region that was devoid of bacteria, as seen by
staining with either the live stain Syto9 (Fig. 6B) or dead
stain propidium iodide (data not shown). The PA4108
mutant produced a flatter biofilm than wild-type with
smaller mushroom structures and reduced biomass
(Fig. 6C; Fig. S4E). The PA4781 mutant produced a
biofilm with little heterogeneity that covered a large
percentage of the surface and encompassed a few
mushroom-like structures (Fig. 6D). Introduction of cloned
PA2572, PA4108 or PA4781 genes into the appropriate
mutant strains restored the formation of mushroom struc-
tures similar to those of the wild-type in each case
(Fig. S4). These differences in architecture of the biofilms
formed by the different mutants provide further support for
the notion that PA2572, PA4108 and PA4781 have distinct
regulatory actions.

Mutation of genes encoding HD-GYP domain proteins
influences virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa

The virulence of different strains of P. aeruginosa to larvae
of G. mellonella were assessed as described in Experi-

mental procedures, using 10 larvae at each inoculum
level. The minimum inoculum of the wild-type required to
kill all 10 larvae was 12 � 3 cfu (n = 9). For strains with
mutation of PA2572, PA4108 and PA4781, a higher level
of bacteria was required to kill all 10 larvae, indicating a
reduction in virulence. The minimum inoculum level (cfu)
was 1000 for the PA2572 mutant, 1100 for the PA4108
mutant and 745 for the PA4781 mutant. Complemented
PA2572, PA4108 and PA4781 strains had wild-type levels
of virulence, with minimum inoculum level between 10
and 15 cfu. All values are the means of quadruplicate
measurements. The whole experiment was repeated
twice with essentially the same result. These findings
indicated that all three HD-GYP domain proteins contrib-
ute to virulence in the Galleria model.

A cryptic regulatory activity of the YN-GYP domain
protein PA2572

In some cases functions of domains within modular pro-
teins may be cryptic and may only be revealed by analysis
of the phenotypes of multiple transposon insertions in
each gene or by the generation of specific deletion
mutants (Kulesekara et al., 2006; Tarutina et al., 2006). A
preliminary indication of such a cryptic activity of the
YN-GYP domain of PA2572 was provided by the analysis
of the motility phenotypes of four mutants with transposon
insertions in different sites in PA2572 (Jacobs et al., 2003;
Fig. 7A, which is a gene of 1344 nt. Although transposon
insertions at positions 113, 615 and 928 did not influence
swarming or twitching, the insertion at position 1107 (in
strain 16841) led to a reduction in both types of motility
(Fig. 7B and C; Fig. S5). All transposon mutants showed
wild-type swimming motility, however (Fig. S5). The inser-

HD-GYP domains from different P. aeruginosa proteins are

domain of RpfG, the rpfG mutant alone and wild-type X. campestris

into the appropriate mutants reduced cyclic di-GMP levels to
wild-type.

tion affecting swarming and twitching is within the region
of PA2572 encoding the uncharacterized C-terminal
extension. Introduction of the wild-type PA2572 gene
cloned in pBBRMCS5-GmR into strain 16841 did not
restore wild-type motility (data not shown). These findings
suggested that truncation of PA2572 had revealed a
dominant negative regulatory activity of the protein on
P. aeruginosa twitching and swarming motility. Although
the insertion in strain 16841 led to a reduction in motility,
there was no effect on the production of pyocyanin,
pyoverdin or rhamnolipid (data not shown).

The YN-GYP domain has a dominant negative
effect on swarming motility

The hypothesis that the truncated PA2572 has a dominant
negative effect on motility was further tested by experi-
ments in which the effects of expression of a truncated
protein with only REC and YN-GYP domains (encoded
by nucleotides 1–1110) were examined. Constructs

expressing a protein with both REC and YN-GYP domains
cloned in pBBRMCS5-GmR or the REC and YN-GYP
domains with a His6 tag cloned into pLAFR3 (see Experi-
mental procedures) were introduced into the wild-type
strains mPAO1 and PAO1. This resulted in a negative
effect on swarming and twitching in both strains (Fig. 8).
These effects were also seen when the construct cloned
in pBBRMCS5-Gm was introduced into strain 8166
(Fig. S6), which has a transposon insertion at position 113
of PA2572 (Fig. 7A). In contrast, expression of either
the REC domain alone, the YN-GYP domain with the
C-terminal extension (both with His6 tags) or of the
YN-GYP domain alone had no effect on swarming motility
(Fig. S7A and data not shown). Western analysis with
antisera against the His6 tag showed that the different
proteins were however expressed (Fig. S7B). Taken
together, these results support the view that PA2572 has
a cryptic dominant negative effect on motility and indicate
that this action requires both the REC and YN-GYP
domains.

production; (B) pyocyanin production; and (C) swarming motility on 0.5% Eiken agar. Mutation of PA2572 did not influence swarming (not
shown). The phenotypic effects of mutation could be reversed by introduction of the cloned genes into the appropriate mutants.

Discussion

HD-GYP domains proteins regulate virulence factor
synthesis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa

The work in this paper provides evidence that the

HD-GYP domain proteins PA4108 and PA4781 are cyclic
di-GMP phosphodiesterases that act in regulation of motil-
ity, synthesis of virulence determinants and biofilm archi-
tecture in P. aeruginosa. Mutation of either PA4108 or
PA4781 leads to a reduction in motility associated with
elevated cellular levels of cyclic di-GMP. Observations
from a range of bacteria have similarly linked lower levels
of the nucleotide with motile behaviour and higher cellular
levels with sessile behaviour and biofilm formation (Simm
et al., 2004). This apparently common action of PA4108
and PA4781 in regulation of motility contrasts with distinct
effects of mutation of PA4108 and PA4781 on biofilm
architecture and the synthesis of virulence determinants;
mutation of PA4108 has different effects to mutation of
PA4781 on the synthesis of pyoverdin and pyocyanin and
only mutation of PA4108 influences the levels of the type
III-secreted effector ExoS. The mechanistic basis for
these apparently diverse actions of HD-GYP domain pro-
teins remains obscure.

An enzymatically inactive HD-GYP domain has a
regulatory role

A number of lines of evidence indicate that the YN-GYP
domain of PA2572 has no activity as a cyclic di-GMP
phosphodiesterase. Expression of PA2572, the YN-GYP
domain attached to the uncharacterized C-terminal
domain or the isolated YN-GYP domain did not restore
extracellular enzyme activity to the rpfG mutant of

X. campestris and had no effect on the levels of cyclic
di-GMP. Furthermore, the H231Y, D232N alteration in the
presumed catalytic diad of the HD-GYP domain of RpfG
abolished the regulatory effect on extracellular enzyme
synthesis in X. campestris. Nevertheless, mutation of

PA2572 influenced biofilm architecture and caused over-
production of rhamnolipid. Boles and colleagues (2005)
have demonstrated that rhamnolipids mediate formation
of hollows or cavities within the centre of P. aeruginosa
biofilms and have proposed that this is associated with the
process of bacterial detachment. It is therefore plausible
that the hollowing of the stalk of the mushroom produced
by the PA2572 mutant is a consequence of the over-
production of rhamnolipid by this strain.

Further to this, a cryptic regulatory role for the YN-GYP
domain on swarming was revealed through the use of
multiple transposon mutants within PA2572 and by
expression of the different domain combinations in the
wild-type P. aeruginosa. Although the complete loss of
PA2572 has no apparent effect on swarming, the loss of
the C-terminal domain results in a protein with a dominant

negative effect. This construct also had no enzymatic
activity against cyclic di-GMP as assessed by heterolo-
gous expression in X. campestris. As pointed out by
Kulesekara and colleagues (2006), analysis of the phe-
notypic effects of expressing such truncated proteins may
or may not represent regulatory functions that occur
during the biological function of the full-length protein. The
mechanism(s) by which the YN-GYP domain exerts these
effects are unknown, but it is plausible that this involves
protein–protein interactions. Yeast two-hybrid analysis
has revealed physical interactions between the HD-GYP
domain of RpfG from Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri
and a range of proteins including several with a GGDEF
domain as well as other regulators (Andrade et al., 2006).
Although the biological relevance of such interactions has
yet to be tested, these observations suggest a scenario
whereby the YN-GYP domain could modulate the activity
of a subset of GGDEF domain proteins or other regulators
(Andrade et al., 2006) with a consequent negative effect
on swarming. It is also possible that the YN-GYP domain
interferes with the action of the HD-GYP domain proteins
PA4108 and PA4718, which have opposite effects on
swarming to (truncated) PA2572.

Conservation of the C-terminal domain of PA2572 in
other HD-GYP domain proteins

Our results are consistent with a model in which the
C-terminal domain of PA2572 acts to inhibit the function of
the YN-GYP domain in regulation of swarming, although
they give no clues as to the mechanism of inhibition or
how this is relieved to allow the proposed action of the
domain. Examination of the databases using BLASTP
indicated that proteins with the same domain structure as
PA2572, including the C-terminal domain, occur in a wide
range of bacteria including other Pseudomonas spp.,
Burkholderia spp. and Vibrio cholerae. Many of these
proteins have variations in the HD motif that include HG,
HN, HE and HQ in addition to YN, which appears to be
restricted to the pseudomonads. It remains to be deter-
mined if these proteins with alteration of the HD diad have
enzymatic activity against cyclic di-GMP.

The finding that an enzymatically inactive HD-GYP
domain can have a regulatory activity has parallels in
studies of GGDEF and EAL domains, where variations in
the amino acids within the GGDEF and EAL motifs occur
naturally in some proteins. Domains with sequences that
are divergent from the consensus may have lost enzy-
matic activity, but may still play a regulatory role. In the
GGDEF-EAL domain proteins CC3396 from Caulobacter
crescentus and FimX from P. aeruginosa, binding of GTP
to an enzymatically inactive GGDEF domain acts to regu-
late the activity of the EAL domain in cyclic di-GMP
hydrolysis (Christen et al., 2005; Kazmierczak et al.,

2006). Similar considerations may apply to inactive EAL
domains (Schmidt et al., 2005), which perhaps can bind
cyclic di-GMP. As well as intramolecular effects, enzymati-
cally inactive EAL or GGDEF domains could conceivably
regulate cellular processes through intermolecular inter-
actions with other proteins or other molecules, in a fashion
influenced by the binding of cyclic di-GMP or GTP.

HD-GYP domain proteins regulate virulence of
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

Mutation of PA2572, PA4108 and PA4781 led to a reduc-
tion in bacterial virulence in the larvae of G. mellonella. In
P. aeruginosa strain PA14, the type III-secreted effectors
ExoT and ExoU have a significant role in G. mellonella
killing, although translocation of ExoT or ExoU alone is
sufficient to give near wild-type levels of killing. (P. aerugi-
nosa PA14 has no exoS gene). As far as we are aware,
the role of ExoS in virulence of P. aeruginosa PAO1 to
G. mellonella has not yet been established. Although
mutation of PA4108 leads to a reduction in the levels of
ExoS we cannot infer a causal relationship to the reduc-
tion of killing; the processes that contribute to virulence
that are regulated by the HD-GYP domain proteins in
bacteria within the host are unknown.

These observations add to a body of work that indicates
a role for proteins with GGDEF and/or EAL domain, and
by inference cyclic di-GMP, in the regulation of virulence
and virulence factor synthesis in P. aeruginosa as well as
in a number of human, animal and plant pathogens includ-
ing Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella spp. and Xanthomonas
campestris (Hisert et al., 2005; Tischler and Camilli, 2005;
Kulesekara et al., 2006; Ryan et al., 2007). As with
P. aeruginosa, the genomes of many of these bacteria
encode between 1 and 4 HD-GYP domain proteins,
although they are absent in Salmonella spp. and E. coli
and more highly represented in Vibrio spp., where V. chol-
erae has 9 and V. vulnificus has 15. HD-GYP domain
proteins are also found in a number of other bacterial
pathogens of animals including Clostridium perfringens,
Bordetella bronchiseptica and Treponema denticola.
Whether these proteins play a significant role in the viru-
lence of these diverse pathogenic bacteria remains to be
determined.

Experimental procedures

Bacterial strains, plasmids and culture conditions

The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are
listed in Table S1. Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were
routinely cultured in Luria–Bertani (LB) broth. Xanthomonas
campestris strains were routinely grown in NYGB medium,
which comprises Bacteriological Peptone (Oxoid, Basing-
stoke, UK), 5 g l-1; yeast extract (Difco), 3 g l-1 and glycerol,

20 g l-1. Antibiotics rifampicin (Rif), tetracycline (Tc), chloram-
phenicol (Cm) and gentamycin (Gm) were added where
appropriate.

Construction and complementation of PA2572, PA4108
and PA4781 mutants

Mutants were created by the disruption of gene with the use
of the suicide plasmid pEX18Gm (see Table S1). Briefly, an
internal fragment of each of the genes was amplified using
the primers detailed in Table S2 and was cloned into the
TOPO (Invitrogen) vector. This fragment was excised with
EcoRI and ligated into the suicide plasmid pEX18Gm cut with
the same enzyme. This construct was introduced into PAO1
by electroporation. Mutants were selected by plating on LB
agar medium containing gentamicin (20 mg ml-1). Candidate
strains were analysed by colony PCR using the primers
detailed in Table S2 to confirm disruption of the PA2572,
PA4108 and PA4781 gene by integration of the suicide
vector. Complementing clones were constructed in
pBBRMCS3 using DNA fragments amplified using primers
detailed in Table S2.

Expression of the HD-GYP domains of P. aeruginosa
proteins in Xanthomonas campestris

DNA fragments encoding the HD-GYP domain from PA2572,
PA4108 and PA4781 with a C-terminal His6-tag were ampli-
fied by PCR by using chromosomal DNA of P. aeruginosa
strain PAO1, as template with primers carrying restriction
sites for BamHI and HindIII (see Table S2). These amplified
fragments were cloned into the TOPO (Invitrogen) vector.
The appropriate DNA fragments were excised from these
constructs using BamHI and HindIII and ligated into pLAFR3
that had been cut with the same enzymes so that expression
is under control of the lac promoter of the vector. Constructs
were introduced into X. campestris wild-type or rpfG mutant
by triparental mating using the helper plasmid pRK2073.
Procedures used for Western analysis to examine protein
expression levels using an anti-His6 antibody are described
in Supporting Information.

Phenotypic analyses

Methods used for assay of extracellular enzyme activities in
X. campestris, and for assays in of motility, pyoverdine, pyo-
cyanin, rhamnolipid and ExoS production in P. aeruginosa
are given in Supporting Information. Virulence of P. aerugi-
nosa to larvae of G. mellonella was tested as described pre-
viously (Miyata et al., 2003). Bacterial suspensions from a
dilution series were inoculated into larvae, with 10 larvae
used for each inoculum level. The minimum inoculum
required to kill all 10 larvae was determined for each strain.
Additional details are given in the Supporting Information.

Cultivation and imaging of biofilms

Biofilms were grown in flow chambers with individual channel
dimensions of 1 ¥ 4 ¥ 40 mm. The flow system was

assembled and prepared as described by Sternberg and
Tolker-Nielsen (2005). The flow chambers were inoculated by
injecting 350 ml of overnight culture diluted to an OD600 of 0.01
into each flow channel with a syringe. After inoculation, flow
channels were left without flow for 1 h, after which medium
flow at a linear rate of 0.2 mm s-1 was started using a Watson
Marlow 205S peristaltic pump.

All microscopic observations and image acquisitions were
performed on an LSM510 confocal laser scanning micro-
scope (CLSM) (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with
detectors and filter sets for monitoring Syto9 fluorescence.
Simulated three-dimensional images, shadow projections
and sections were generated using the Imaris software
package (Bitplane AG, Zürich, Switzerland).

Detection and quantification of cyclic di-GMP

The method for detection and quantification of cyclic di-GMP
from X. campestris or P. aeruginosa strains was adapted
from Simm and colleagues (2004; 2005). Details are given in

the regulatory function on extracellular enzyme synthesis.
Unlike the wild-type HD-GYP domain, an H231Y D232N
variant (labelled YN-GYP) carrying a C terminal His6 tag, is
unable to restore production of mannanase (A) and endoglu-
canase (B) to the rpfG mutant of X. campestris. Values given
are the means and standard errors of triplicate measure-
ments. Variants with the single alteration H231Y or D232N
also lost the regulatory ability (data not shown). (C) Western
blot analysis with an anti-His6 antiserum shows that all
variant proteins are expressed in X. campestris. Lanes: 1,
rpfG (pLAFR3); 2, rpfG (HD-GYPHis6); 3, rpfG (YD-
GYPHis6); 4, rpfG (YN-GYPHis6).

medium was measured as described by Boles and col-

behaviour of the mutants is indistinguishable from the wild-
type mPAO1 on (A) Eiken medium with 0.3% agar or (B) CAA
medium with 0.3% agar. (C) Swarming motility on CAA
medium solidified with 0.6% agar at pH 7.4 is affected only in
strain 16841, which has the transposon insertion located at

nt 1107. (D) Twitching motility on CAA medium solidified with
0.5% agar at pH 7.4 is also only affected in strain 16841.
Fig. S6. The negative influence of expression of PA2572
with a Cterminal truncation on swarming motility is also seen
in a PA2572 mutant background. Swarming motility (A and B)
and swimming motility (C and D) were assessed in the
P. aeruginosa wild-type mPA01 and mutant strain 8166,
these strains carrying the cloning vector pBBRMCS5
(labelled as vector) and these strains carrying a construct
expressing the C-terminally truncated PA2572 protein
(labelled as Insert). Introduction of pTRUN into mPA01 and
strain 8166 influences swarming motility over that seen with
the vector control (A and B) but has no effect on swimming
compared with a vector control (C and D). Note that the
pBBRMCS5 vector alone has an influence on both forms of
motility. Shown are representatives of swimming and swarm-
ing plates after 18 h of incubation.
Fig. S7. Expression of the isolated REC domain of PA2572
in mPAO1 does not influence swarming motility. (A) The REC
domain of PA2572 expressed using pBBRMCS-5 does not
give the swarming-negative phenotype in a P. aeruginosa
mPAO1 or in strain 8166 (shown). Introduction of the REC
domain with a His6 tag expressed using pLAFR3 gave the
same result. This contrasts with the effects seen with expres-
sion of REC-YN-GYP (the truncated PA2572) using pTRUN,
which gives substantially reduced swarming (see Fig. S5).
(B) Western blot analysis with an anti-His6 antiserum shows
that both the REC domain and REC-YN-GYP domain
proteins are expressed in mPAO1. Lanes: 1, mPAO1
(pBBRMCS); 2, mPAO1 (pLAFR3); 3, mPAO1 (pRECHis6);
4, mPAO1 (pTRUNHis6).

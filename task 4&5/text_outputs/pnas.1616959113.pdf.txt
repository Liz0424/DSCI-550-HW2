Correction for “Interplay of mevalonate and Hippo pathways
regulates RHAMM transcription via YAP to modulate breast
cancer cell motility,” by Zhongyuan Wang, Yanping Wu, Haifeng
Wang, Yangqing Zhang, Lin Mei, Xuexun Fang, Xudong Zhang,
Fang Zhang, Hongbo Chen, Ying Liu, Yuyang Jiang, Shengnan
Sun, Yi Zheng, Na Li, and Laiqiang Huang, which appeared in
issue 1, January 7, 2014, of Proc Natl Acad Sci USA (111:E89–E98;
first published December 23, 2013; 10.1073/pnas.1319190110).
The authors wish to note the following: “An error occurred by

accident in panel NT (the nontreatment control) of Fig. 3G, in
which the correct original image for the panel did not appear,
while instead the image for panel NT+RHAMM of Fig. 3H was
placed here erroneously. We sincerely apologize for this careless
error, although it fortunately did not alter the overall basic re-
sults or conclusions of the figure or the article.” The corrected
figure and its legend appear below.

Fig. 3. YAP and TEAD are required for RHAMM expression, ERK activity, and BCCMI, whereas ectopic expression of RHAMM bypasses the requirement.
(A and B) Knockdown of YAP or TEAD1/3/4 decreased RHAMM transcription (A) and protein (B) levels. MDA-MB-231 cells were infected with the indicated
shRNA lentiviruses, and RHAMM mRNA (A) and protein (B) levels were determined by real-time RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. (B) (Right) Quanti-
fication of the protein bands. (C) Knockdown of YAP or TEAD1/3/4 reduced CTGF mRNA levels (experiments as in A). (D and E) Overexpression of YAP in-
creased RHAMM mRNA (D) and protein (E) levels. HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected with the indicated YAP plasmids, and, 48 h later, total RNA was
extracted to detect RHAMM mRNA by using real-time RT-PCR (D). (E) Cell lysates were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies (Left), and the protein
bands were quantified (Right). (F) Knockdown of YAP or TEAD1/3/4 decreased ERK phosphorylation levels. Experiments were as in B except Western blot was
performed with the indicated antibodies. (G and H) Knockdown of YAP or TEAD1/3/4 decreased MDA-MB-231 cell migration (G, Left) and invasion (H, Left),
whereas reexpression of RHAMM rescued the effects (G and H, Right). Data are shown as mean ± SD of three independent experiments. Student two-tailed
t test was used for statistical analysis (*P < 0.05 and ***P < 0.001).

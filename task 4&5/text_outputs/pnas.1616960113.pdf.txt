Correction

MEDICAL SCIENCES
Correction for “LRP-6 is a coreceptor for multiple fibrogenic
signaling pathways in pericytes and myofibroblasts that are in-
hibited by DKK-1,” by Shuyu Ren, Bryce G. Johnson, Yujiro
Kida, Colin Ip, Kathryn C. Davidson, Shuei-Liong Lin, Akio
Kobayashi, Richard A. Lang, Anna-Katerina Hadjantonakis,
Randall T. Moon, and Jeremy S. Duffield, which appeared in
issue 4, January 22, 2013, of Proc Natl Acad Sci USA (110:1440–1445;
first published January 9, 2013; 10.1073/pnas.1211179110).
The authors wish to note the following: “Panel L in Fig. 3

incorrectly showed a low-power image of fibrosis extent in sham
kidneys exposed to Ad-control instead of Ad-Dkk1. This problem
has now been corrected by replacing the upper left image with a
representative panel from sham kidney treated with Ad-Dkk1.” The
corrected Fig. 3 and its legend appear below.

Fig. 3. DKK-1 blocks pericyte activation and transition to myofibroblasts and reverses myofibroblast activation in vivo, inhibiting fibrogenesis, capillary rarefaction,
and inflammation. (A) Western blots of 5 μL of plasma from mice 5 d after i.v. injection of Ad-control or Ad-DKK-1 and from mice subjected to sham surgery and
injected with control. (B) Experimental schemata for adenoviral administration, kidney injury, and analysis in the UUO model. (C–M) Prevention studies. (C) Low-
magnification confocal images of kidney cortex 4 d after sham operation or UUO in Coll-GFPTr mice that had received Ad-control or Ad-DKK-1 6 d previously, showing
Coll-GFP cells or PDGFRβ cells. g, glomerulus; a, arteriole. (D–F) Graphs showing quantification of Coll-GFP cells, PDGFRβ cells, and αSMA cells in kidney 4 d after UUO.
(G) Proportion of Coll-GFP cells that express the proliferation marker Ki67. (Hand I) Western blot of GFP (H) or αSMA/CTGF (I) in whole Coll-GFP mouse kidney 4 d after
UUO. (J) Quantification of macrophage numbers in kidney sections detected by F4/80 staining. (K) Western blot quantifying canonical WNT signaling by detecting the
H2B-GFP fusion protein after Ad-DKK-1 vs. Ad-control treatment of TCF/Lef:H2B-GFPTr reporter mice during UUO kidney injury. (L) Sirius red-stained kidneys 10 d after
UUO. (M) Morphometry of Sirius red-stained collagen (Upper) or qPCR for Col1a1transcripts (Lower) 10 d after UUO in mice treated with Ad-control vs. Ad-DKK-1.
(N–P) Reversal studies. Confocal Images (N) and morphometric quantification (O) of αSMA staining 10 d after UUO in mice treated with Ad-control or Ad-DKK-1 from
day 4. (P) Quantification of capillary density 10 d after UUO. Note that rarefaction occurs in response to kidney disease, but DKK-1 partially reverses rarefaction.
(Q) Pericyte detachment. Images and quantification of pericyte area in Coll-GFP mice 2 d after UUO in the presence of circulating DKK-1 or control. Note that injury to
the kidney stimulated pericyte spreading and detachment from endothelium (arrowheads). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. n = 4–6 per group. Error bars indicate SEM.

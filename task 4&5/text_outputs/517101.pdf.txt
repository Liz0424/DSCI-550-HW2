Abstract
Objective: Na+-K+-ATPase (NKA) is essential in maintaining 
cell permeability, reserving potential energy, and prevent-
ing cellular edema. Nevertheless, how NKA expression is 
altered and regulated in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal 
polyps (CRSwNPs) remain uncertain. Therefore, the pres-
ent study aimed to explore the expression and regulation 
of NKA in CRSwNP. Methods: NKA immunolabeling was as-
sessed by the immunohistochemistry method, NKA protein 
levels were detected with the Western blotting method, 
and mRNA levels of NKA and aquaporin-5 (AQP5) were as-
sayed by real-time PCR in nasal tissues from CRSwNP and 
control subjects. The co-localization of NKA with inflam-
matory cells was evaluated by immunofluorescence stain-
ing. In addition, human nasal epithelial cells (HNECs) were 
cultured and stimulated using various stimulators to eval-
uate the regulation of NKA. Results: We found significant-
ly decreased NKA positive cells, NKA protein levels, and 
mRNA levels of NKA and AQP5 in nasal tissues from 
CRSwNP patients compared to control subjects, especially 

in eosinophilic CRSwNP. Furthermore, NKA mRNA levels in 
HNECs were downregulated by staphylococcal enterotox-
in B (SEB), lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), inflammatory cyto-
kine (IFN)-γ, IL-4, IL-13, and IL-1β. Conclusion: NKA and 
AQP5 expressions were decreased in CRSwNP. NKA in 
HNECs could be suppressed by SEB, LPS, IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-13, 
and IL-1β. Impairment of NKA may contribute to the gen-
esis and development of CRSwNP via inducing AQP5 
downregulation and edema. © 2021 S. Karger AG, Basel

Introduction

Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNPs) 
is a multifactorial and heterogeneous disease with persis-
tent and exaggerated inflammation in sinonasal mucosa, 
which negatively affects patient’s quality of life and ag-
gravates their financial burdens [1–3]. Considerable data 
indicate that CRSwNP is caused by the complicated inter-
actions among various inflammatory cells and mediators 
[4–6], whereas, the precise pathogenetic mechanism of 
CRSwNP remains uncertain.

Na+-K+-ATPase ([NKA] also named as Na+ pump or 
Na+-K+ pump) is an electrogenic transmembrane ATPase 
for exporting 3 Na+ out of cells and importing 2 K+ into 
cells against their electrochemical gradients simultane-
ously by consuming 1 ATP molecule to sustain the ho-
meostasis of Na+-K+ [7]. NKA plays a crucial role in 
maintaining cell permeability, reserving potential energy, 
and preventing cellular edema [8]. Impairment of NKA 
could induce Na+-K+ homeostatic imbalance, leading to 
depolarization of the resting membrane potential, osmot-
ic imbalance, and cellular edema [9, 10]. Previous reports 
indicate that impairment of NKA contributes to pulmo-
nary edema and inflammation in acute respiratory dis-
tress syndrome [11, 12]. Aquaporin-5 (AQP5), one type 
of AQPs, has been showed to be essential in the liquid 
homeostasis of human nasal epithelial cells (HNECs). 
One previous report indicates that NKA and AQP5 levels 
were downregulated concurrently and then exacerbated 
the formation of edema by failed water clearance in the 
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus-in-
fected pig lungs [14].

This study sought to explore the expression and regu-
lation of NKA in CRSwNP. First, we assessed NKA im-
munolabeling and protein levels, mRNA levels of NKA 
and AQP5, and co-localization of NKA with inflamma-
tory cells in nasal tissue samples from CRSwNP patients 
and control subjects. Second, in vitro studies, HNECs 
were cultured and stimulated using various stimulators to 
evaluate the regulation of NKA.

Materials and Methods

Subjects and Tissue Samples
A total of 88 subjects, consisting of 30 patients with eosino-

philic CRSwNP (ECRSwNP), 32 patients with non-ECRSwNP 
(nECRSwNP), and 26 control subjects were enrolled in the pres-
ent study. The diagnostic criteria of CRSwNP, ECRSwNP, and 
nECRSwNP were established according to previous published 
articles [15–17]. During endoscopic surgery, we collected NP, un-
cinate process (UP), and HNECs from CRSwNP patients and 
control subjects. Subjects without CRS undergoing skull base sur-
gery, lacrimal duct surgery, or septoplasty for deviated septum 
were defined as control subjects whose UPs were collected as con-
trol tissues. Detailed characteristics of all the subjects are listed 
in online suppl. Table 1; for all online suppl. material, see www.
karger.com/doi/10.1159/000517101. This study was approved by 
the Ethical Committee of Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affili-
ated Sixth People’s Hospital and we received written informed 
consents from all the study participants.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blotting were em-
ployed to assess NKA immunolabeling and protein levels, respec-
tively. In addition, real-time PCR was used to detect NKA and 
AQP5 mRNA levels in nasal tissue samples. The co-localization of 

NKA with inflammatory cells was evaluated by immunofluores-
cence staining. In vitro studies, HNECs were cultured and incu-
bated with different stimulators, and then, real-time PCR and the 
NKA activity assay kit were performed to assess the effects and 
mechanism of stimulators on the cells. More detailed information 
is provided in the online suppl. material.

Histological, Immunohistochemical, and Immunofluorescent 
Staining
Histological, immunohistochemical, and immunofluorescent 

staining were performed as previously described [18]. Eosinophils 
were stained using hematoxylin-eosin staining and counted. IHC 
was employed to assess NKA expression in patients with CRSwNP 
and control subjects. Immunofluorescent staining was performed 
to evaluate the presence of NKA in CD3, CD20, CD138, CD68, 
CD163, major basic protein, myeloperoxidase, or tryptase positive 
cells.

Western Blotting
The expression of NKA protein in nasal tissues from patients 

with CRSwNP and control subjects was assayed with Western blot-
ting methods.

Quantitative Real-Time Reverse Transcription PCR
Quantitative real-time PCR was employed to assess NKA and 

AQP5 mRNA expression in nasal tissues from patients with 
CRSwNP and control subjects. Total RNA in the collected tissues 
was extracted utilizing the RNeasy commercial kit (Qiagen, 
Chatsworth, CA, USA) as previously described [19, 20].

HNECs Culture and Stimulation
HNECs were scraped from 8 control subjects, 8 nECRSwNP 

patients, and 8 nECRSwNP patients, and cultured under air-
liquid interface conditions as previously described [21]. Briefly, 
HNECs were incubated with different stimulators involving 
staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), 
poly I:C (dsRNA), cytokines including inflammatory cytokine 
(IFN)-γ, IL-4, IL-13, IL-17A, TNF-α, and IL-1β at a certain con-
centration (10 ng/mL, except SEB was 0.5 μg/mL, LPS was 1 μg/
mL, and poly I:C was 25 μg/mL) for 24 h. Following stimulation, 
HNECs were collected for NKA mRNA and NKA activity mea-
surement.

Quantitative Real-Time Reverse Transcription PCR
NKA mRNA levels of the incubated cells were assayed by the 

real-time PCR method.

NKA Activity Measurement
NKA activity of HNECs was assayed using the NKA activity 

assay kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Statistical Analysis
A p value <0.05 was deemed as statistically significant. Mann-

Whitney U tests or Kruskal-Wallis H tests were applied to com-
pare between-group or intergroup data of nasal tissue samples. 
The Spearman test was used to evaluate correlations. The paired 
t test was used to analyze cell culture data. Tissue sample data 
were expressed as dot plots with medians and interquartile rang-
es. Cell culture data were presented as mean ± standard error of 
the mean.

Results

Decreased NKA Immunolabeling in CRSwNP
NKAs were mainly distributed in the plasma membrane 

of nasal mucosal epithelial cells, glandular epithelial cells, 
and vascular endothelial cells (Fig.  1a). Decreased NKA 
positive cells were distributed in NP tissues from patients 
with CRSwNP including ECRSwNP and nECRSwNP com-
pared to control UP samples (Fig. 1a–c). Furthermore, NKA 
immune reactivity levels were markedly downregulated in 
NP tissues from patients with ECRSwNP in contrast to that 
from patients with nECRSwNP (Fig. 1a–c).

Detection of NKA Protein Levels in Nasal Tissues
Of note, significantly weaker bands of NKA protein 

were detected in nasal tissue samples from CRSwNP pa-
tients compared to control UP samples, particularly in 
ECRSwNP (Fig. 1d, e).

Detection of NKA and AQP5 mRNA Levels in Nasal 
Tissues
Of interest, we also found lower mRNA levels of NKA and 

AQP5 in nasal tissues from patients with CRSwNP including 
ECRSwNP and nECRSwNP compared to UP samples from 
control subjects, particularly in ECRSwNP (Fig. 2a, b). In ad-
dition, NKA mNRA levels were positively correlated with 
AQP5 mRNA levels in samples from CRSwNP and control 
subjects (Spearman’s test, r = 0.726, p < 0.001; Fig. 2c).

Co-Localization of NKA in Inflammatory Cells
Dual immunofluorescent staining was used to evaluate 

co-localization of NKA with inflammatory cells including 
CD3 (T cell), CD20 (B cell), CD138 (plasma cell), CD68 (pan 
macrophage), CD163 (M2 macrophage), major basic protein 
(eosinophil), myeloperoxidase (neutrophil), and tryptase 
(mast cell). Notably, NKA was expressed weakly in a minor-
ity of mast cells and plasma cells (Fig. 3a, b), and NKA was 
not detected in pan macrophages, M2 macrophages, eosino-
phils, neutrophils, T cells, and B cells (Fig. 3c–h).

Effects of Various Stimulators on NKA mRNA Levels 
and NKA Activities in HNECs
In vitro studies, HNECs were cultured and stimulated 

using various stimulators to study the regulation of NKA in 
HNECs. Interestingly, we found significant downregula-
tion of NKA mRNA levels and NKA activities in the HNECs 
following SEB, LPS, IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-13, and IL-1β treat-
ment, respectively (Fig. 4a, b). In addition, no significant 
changes in NKA mRNA levels and NKA activities were ob-
served after poly I:C, IL-17A, and TNF-α (Fig. 4a, b).

Na+-K+-ATPase in Nasal Epithelial Cells 
of CRSwNP

Discussion

Previous studies have indicated that numerous glands 
and few edema in sinonasal mucosa are histopathologi-
cal characteristics of normal nasal tissues, while few 
glands, obvious edema, and exacerbated inflammation in 
sinonasal mucosa are main histopathological character-
istics of CRSwNP [22], whereas, the etiology and mecha-
nism of the characteristics of CRSwNP remain unclear. 
There is ample evidence that homeostasis of Na+ and K+ 
is essential in cell life activities, and NKA serves to regu-
late this homeostasis by exporting Na+ and importing K+ 
in a variety of cells [9]. NKA dysfunction can lead to  
Na+-K+ homeostatic imbalance, osmotic imbalance, and 
cellular edema [23]. However, whether NKA expression 
is altered and regulated in CRSwNP remains unknown. 

Therefore, this study aimed to explore the expression 
and regulation of NKA in CRSwNP.

As indicated in IHC findings, NKA was mainly distrib-
uted in the plasma membrane of nasal mucosal epithelial 
cells, glandular epithelial cells, and vascular endothelial 
cells, and decreased NKA levels were found in CRSwNP 
compared to control UP samples, particularly in ECRSwNP, 
indicating that NKA function is impaired in nasal mucosal 
epithelial cells, glandular epithelial cells, and vascular endo-
thelial cells in CRSwNP, particularly in ECRSwNP. Using 
IHC, Western blotting, and real-time PCR methods, we 
demonstrated that NKA positive cells and protein levels, 
and mRNA levels of NKA and AQP5 were decreased in na-
sal tissues from CRSwNP patients, especially ECRSwNP pa-
tients, indicating that NKA and AQP5 levels are downregu-
lated in CRSwNP. As a corollary, impairment of NKA may

CRSwNP, the more severe the inflammation in CRSwNP, 
indicating that NKA may be used as an important indicator 
to predict the degree of inflammation in CRSwNP, which 
would provide guidances for clinical diagnosis of CRSwNP 
and distinguishing between ECRSwNP and nECRSwNP. In 
our opinion, both reasons including fewer total cells and the 
level of NKA expression are reduced in each cell in ECRSwNP 
compared to nECRSwNP or control UPs may be related to 
NKA downregulation in ECRSwNP, in other words, exacer-

lead to AQP5 downregulation, resulting in the impairment 
of maintaining cell permeability, reserving potential energy, 
and preventing cellular edema, which may be related with 
edema formation in CRSwNP, particularly in ECRSwNP 
which has more exacerbated and persistent inflammation 
compared to nECRSwNP. Previous studies have shown that 
inverse relationship between NKA activity and inflamma-
tion degree was involved in a variety of inflammatory dis-
eases [24, 25]. As a corollary, the lower NKA levels in

Na+-K+-ATPase in Nasal Epithelial Cells 
of CRSwNP

bated inflammation in ECRSwNP could cause fewer NKA-
expressing cells and lower NKA levels in each cell.

Among inflammatory cells, NKA was expressed weakly 
in a minority of mast cells and plasma cells and not detected 
in pan macrophages, M2 macrophages, eosinophils, neutro-
phils, T cells, and B cells. These results indicate that NKA 
function may be impaired in mast cells and plasma cells, pan 
macrophages, M2 macrophages, eosinophils, neutrophils, T 
cells, and B cells. Less NKA localization to these inflamma-
tory cells may suggest that NKA may not exert its function 
on these inflammatory cells just like abovementioned epi-
thelial cells, and a novel treatment targeting NKA should be 
performed on epithelial cells instead of these inflammatory 
cells, which would provide guidances for clinical targeted 
NKA therapy on CRSwNP in the future.

In HNECs culture and stimulation experiment, NKA 
mRNA levels and NKA activities were significantly sup-
pressed by SEB, LPS, IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-13, and IL-1β. These 
findings were partially in line with previous reports indicat-
ing that NKA expression or activity could be suppressed by 
SEB, LPS, IFN-γ, IL-1β, or TNF-α intervention on a variety 
of tissues and cells including rat intestinal mucosa [26], rat 
astrocytes [27], human intestinal xenografts [28], rat car-
diac myocytes [29], and HepG2 cells (a human liver cancer 
cell line) [30], et al. Previous studies have indicated the SEB 
and LPS could exacerbate inflammatory responses of 
HNECs in CRSwNP [31–33], thus, collectively, it can be 
surmised that NKA function in HNECs is impaired follow-
ing SEB and LPS treatment, indicating that bacterial infec-
tion could trigger aggravation of inflammation via impair-
ing NKA function in HNECs. In addition, type 1 IFN-γ, 
type 2 IFNs (IL-4 and IL-13), and IL-1β could also exert 
important roles in the inflammatory responses in CRSwNP 
[4, 34, 35]; therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that NKA 
function in HNECs is also impaired following type 1 IFN-γ, 
type 2 IFNs (IL-4 and IL-13), and IL-1β stimulation, indi-
cating that these IFNs could also induce trigger inflamma-
tory responses via impairing NKA function in HNECs.

In addition, no significant changes in NKA mRNA 
levels and NKA activities were observed after poly I:C, IL-
17A, and TNF-α stimulation. To some extent, this dis-
crepancy may be due to the differences between HNECs 
and other tissues and cells.

Some limitations of our study should be noted. First, 
due to the difficulty of isolating glandular epithelial cells 
and vascular endothelial cells from nasal tissues, we only 
used nasal epithelial cells to perform in vitro studies, glan-
dular epithelial cells and vascular endothelial cells need to 
be isolated to further precisely assess the effects and 
mechanism of NKA in CRSwNP in the future. Second, we 

only study NKA expression and regulation in CRSwNP, 
downstream signaling pathway of NKA in CRSwNP 
needs to be further explored and clarified in the future to 
make a more detailed and precise evaluation on the role 
and mechanism of NKA in CRSwNP.

Conclusion

NKA and AQP5 expression were decreased in CRSwNP. 
NKA in HNECs could be suppressed by SEB, LPS, IFN-γ, 
IL-4, IL-13, and IL-1β. Impairment of NKA may contrib-
ute to the genesis and development of CRSwNP via induc-
ing AQP5 downregulation and edema.

The adipokine adiponectin is well known to affect the function of immune cells and upregulation of CCL2
by adiponectin in monocytes/macrophages has already been reported. In the current study the effect of
adiponectin on CCL2, -3, -4, and -5 and their corresponding receptors CCR1, CCR2, and CCR5 has been
analyzed. Adiponectin elevates mRNA and protein of the CC chemokines in primary human monocytes.
Simultaneously the surface abundance of CCR2 and CCR5 is reduced while CCR1 is not affected. Down-
regulation of CCR2 by adiponectin is blocked by a CCR2 antagonist although expression of the CCL2 reg-
ulated genes CCR2 and TGF-beta 1 is not altered in the adiponectin-incubated monocytes. CCL2, -3, and -5
concentrations measured in supernatants of monocytes of normal-weight (NW), overweight (OW), and
type 2 diabetic (T2D) patients positively correlate with BMI and are increased in obesity and T2D. In con-
trast CCL4 is similarly abundant in the supernatants of all of these monocytes. The degree of adiponectin-
mediated induction of the chemokines CCL3, -4, and -5 negatively correlates with their basal levels and
upregulation of CCL3 and CCL5 is significantly impaired in OW and T2D cells. Serum concentrations of
these chemokines are almost equal in the three groups and do not correlate with the levels in monocyte
supernatants. In conclusion these data demonstrate that adiponectin stimulates release of CCL2 to CCL5
in primary human monocytes, and induction in cells of overweight probands is partly impaired. Adipo-
nectin also lowers surface abundance of CCR2 and CCR5 and downregulation of CCR2 seems to depend on
autocrine/paracrine effects of CCL2.

1. Introduction

Chemokines of the CC family attract mononuclear cells to sites
of inflammation [1]. CCL2 (Chemokine CC Motif Ligand 2, also
known as Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1, MCP-1) is the
most extensively studied chemokine so far [1]. CCL2 deficiency is
associated with a higher susceptibility to infections and impaired
immune response [2,3]. However, concentrations of this chemo-
kine are also increased in metabolic diseases and contribute to sys-
temic and tissue inflammation [4]. In atherosclerotic lesions higher
CCL2 production promotes infiltration of monocytes thereby accel-
erating foam cell formation [5]. In obesity CCL2 attracts monocytes
to fat tissues increasing local and systemic inflammation [6]. CCL2
mRNA expression is also found induced in peripheral monocytes of
type 2 diabetic patients [7]. CCL2 is the ligand of the G-protein cou-
pled receptor CCR2 whose expression is increased in monocytes of
hypercholesterolemic and type 2 diabetes patients [8,9]. Blockage

of CCR2 or CCR2 deficiency protects from obesity, inflammation,
and insulin resistance in rodent models of obesity [6,10].

The role of other CC chemokines including Macrophage Inflam-
matory Protein (MIP)-1a (CCL3), MIP-1b (CCL4), and CCL5 (Regu-
lated on Activation Normal T-cell Expressed And Secreted,
RANTES), and their corresponding receptors CCR1 (CCL3, CCL5)
and CCR5 (CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5) has been less well characterized
in metabolic diseases [1]. These chemokines are all released by
monocytes and their synthesis is enhanced by lipopolysaccharide
stimulation [11]. Systemic CCL5 is increased in serum of type 2 dia-
betes patients [12]. Similar to CCL2 this chemokine enhances the
recruitment of blood monocytes to adipose tissue. Furthermore,
CCL5 protects adipose tissue resident macrophages from apoptosis
thereby further elevating fat inflammation [13]. In contrast CCL3
deficiency is not associated with altered accumulation of macro-
phages in adipose tissue [14]. CCL4 has been mainly analyzed for
its role in autoimmune diseases and it protects from insulitis [15].

Adiponectin is an adipocyte-derived adipokine with immuno-
regulatory, antidiabetic, and antiatherosclerotic properties
[16,17]. Adiponectin exerts anti-inflammatory effects in activated
monocytes and suppression of LPS-mediated IL-6 and CXCL8

synthesis has been shown [18,19]. In non-stimulated cells these
proteins are even induced by adiponectin suggesting an immuno-
regulatory function of this adipokine [20,21]. Upregulation of
CCL2 by adiponectin has been demonstrated in cultured human
microvascular endothelial cells, colonic epithelial cells, and mono-
cytes/macrophages [20–22]. Adiponectin mediated induction of
this chemokine is even essential for the appropriate expression
of CCL2 in response to Listeria monocytogenes infection and im-
mune defense [23].

So far it has not been analysed whether chemokine receptors
are altered upon adiponectin incubation. Monocytes express
CCR1, CCR2, and CCR5, and mRNA expression is reduced upon
LPS treatment [24]. LPS further induces internalisation and subse-
quent degradation of CCR2 [25]. Short-term incubation of mono-
cytes with CCL2 causes rapid CCR2 internalization but prolonged
incubation with this chemokine induces CCR2 expression [26,27].
Therefore, it may be speculated that at least abundance of CCR2
is altered in adiponectin-treated monocytes because of paracrine/
autocrine effects due to increased CCL2 concentrations.

In the current study it was analysed whether adiponectin regu-
lates CCL2, CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5 and their corresponding receptors
CCR1, -2, and -5 in primary human monocytes.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Subjects

The study protocol was approved by the local ethics committee
and the investigation conforms with the principles outlined in the
Declaration of Helsinki (1997). Each proband gave written in-
formed consent to participate in the study.

Monocytes were isolated from the blood of 11 male T2D pa-
tients, 12 male controls with a BMI > 25 kg/m2 (overweight control
group, OW) and 10 male controls with a BMI 6 25 kg/m2 (normal-
weight controls, NW). T2D patients were treated with drugs like
metformin. Further two patients were treated with ACE inhibitors,
one patient with lipid lowering drugs, and two patients with b-
blockers. In the OW group one patient was treated with lipid low-
ering drugs. In the NW group one patient got ACE inhibitors and
one patient was treated with lipid lowering drugs. The characteris-
tics of the study group are summarized in Table 1. This cohort in-
cludes patient samples of recently described study groups [28,29].

2.2. Material

Recombinant human adiponectin expressed in a mammalian
cell line, CCL2-, CCL3-, CCL4-, and CCL5 ELISAs were from R&D Sys-
tems (Wiesbaden-Nordenstadt, Germany). Antibodies to detect
CCR1, CCR2, and CCR5 by flow cytometry were from R&D Systems

done using antibodies for CCR1, -2 and -5 from Biozol (Eching, Ger-
many). Anti-mouse PE-conjugated IgG antibody was from DAKO
(Glostrup, Denmark). CCR2 antagonist RS-102895 was from Sigma
Bioscience (Deisenhofen, Germany) and 20 lM were used.

2.3. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)

Real-time PCR was performed using LightCycler FastStart DNA
Master SYBR Green I from Roche (Mannheim, Germany) as described
elsewhere [21,30]. The primer sequences are listed in Table 2. Data
were normalized to b-actin mRNA levels. The specificity of the PCRs
was confirmed by sequencing of the PCR fragments (Geneart,
Regensburg, Germany).

2.4. Isolation and culture of primary blood monocytes

Peripheral blood leukocytes were isolated from 40 ml of whole
blood using Vacutainer CPT systems (Becton Dickinson, Franklin
Lakes, NJ) as described [31]. Primary human monocytes were puri-
fied by magnetic separation with CD14 beads (Miltenyi Biotec,
Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Serum was coagulated with Throm-
borel S (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and CaCl2 (Calbiochem-
Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and was dialyzed two times against
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 2 h each. Flow cytometry anal-
ysis revealed that about 95% of the isolated cells were monocytes
[31]. 3 � 106 monocytes were cultivated in 3 ml RPMI supple-
mented with 10% autologous serum for 24 h. Subsequently, the
medium was replaced with 1 ml fresh medium. For adiponectin
stimulation monocytes were incubated for 24 h with 10 lg/ml
adiponectin until indicated otherwise. Cells and supernatants were
collected 24 h later and used for ELISA and western blot analysis.

2.5. Elisa

ELISAs were performed as recommended by the distributor.
Supernatants were diluted 10-fold to measure CCL2, 4-fold to mea-
sure CCL3, 2-fold to measure CCL4, and 5-fold to measure CCL5.
CCL5 serum levels are in the ng/ml range and concentrations added
to the monocyte culture medium were subtracted before perform-
ing calculations. Serum was used undiluted for CCL2 and CCL4
determinations, 2-fold diluted for CCL3 and 100-fold diluted for
CCL5 determinations.

2.6. Immunoblot

Cells were solubilized in radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis
buffer. Proteins (10–20 lg) were separated by SDS–PAGE and were
transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad, Mu-

were performed in 1.5% BSA in PBS and 0.1% Tween overnight.
Detection of the immune complexes was carried out with the en-
hanced chemiluminescence Western blot detection system (Amer-
sham Pharmacia, Deisenhofen, Germany). Quantification was done
using Optiquant software.
2.7. Flow cytometry

Monocytes of four (CCR1 measurement) to six (CCR2 and CCR5
analysis) different donors were isolated and 5 � 106 cells were cul-
tivated on petriPERM dishes (Sarstedt, Nürnbrecht, Germany) for
24 h as described above. Medium was replaced and cells were
incubated with or without recombinant adiponectin (10 lg/ml)
for 24 h. For cell removal, petriPERM dishes were placed on a cold
metal block for 10 min and cells were collected in cold PBS. After
centrifugation, cells were incubated on ice for 1 h with 25 lg/ml
CCR1, CCR2 or CCR5 antibody or the respective isotypes, IgG1 (iso-
type for CCR2 and CCR5 antibodies) and IgG2b (isotype for CCR1
antibodies). Following, cells were washed with cold PBS, resus-
pended in 100 ll ice-cold PBS and incubated with anti-mouse
R0439 PE-conjugated antibody (1:50-fold diluted) for 45 min on
ice in the dark. Subsequently cells were washed with ice-cold

metric analysis was performed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer
(BD, Heidelberg, Germany). Data were acquired with CELL-Quest
software (BD, Heidelberg, Germany).

2.8. Statistics

Data are presented as the median values and the range of the
values (PASW Statistics 17.0). Data in Fig. 1 are shown as
mean ± standard error of the mean because data of only two differ-
ent experiments using monocytes of two donors are shown. Statis-
tical differences were analyzed by two-tailed Mann–Whitney U
Test or Studentś t-test for paired samples and a value of p < 0.05
was regarded as significant. The Spearman-Rho correlation was
calculated using the PASW Statistics 17.0 software.
3. Results

3.1. Adiponectin upregulates chemokine mRNA and protein in human
monocytes

Monocytes were isolated from the blood of two normal-weight
donors and were incubated with different concentrations of adipo-
nectin for 24 h. Release of CCL2, -3, -4 and -5 was dose-depen-
dently increased when 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 and 10 lg/ml adiponectin
were used (Fig. 1A–D). Higher concentrations of 12.5 and 15 lg/
ml did not further elevate CCL3 and CCL4 whereas CCL2 and
CCL5 even tended to be decreased (Fig. 1A–D). Therefore, 10 lg/
ml adiponectin was used for further studies.

Chemokines were measured in the supernatants of monocytes
isolated from the blood of eight normal-weight donors and subse-
quently cultivated with or without 10 lg/ml adiponectin for 24 h.
CCL3, -4, and -5 were all significantly increased in the supernatants
of adiponectin-treated cells (Fig. 2B–D), as well as CCL2 which has
already been described to be induced by adiponectin [17]
) CCL2, (B) CCL3, (C) CCL4, and (D) CCL5 in the supernatants of monocytes incubated
o independent experiments are shown as mean ± standard error of the mean.

(Fig. 2A). CCL3 was significantly more induced than CCL2 and CCL5
and tended to be more efficiently upregulated compared to CCL4
whereas the effect of adiponectin on CCL2, CCL4, and CCL5 was sim-
ilar (Fig. 2E). The mRNA expression of these chemokines was ana-
lysed by real-time RT-PCR in monocytes isolated from the blood
of five different donors and was found significantly enhanced in
the adiponectin-incubated cells (p = 0.034 for CCL2, p = 0.017 for
CCL3, p = 0.026 for CCL4 and p = 0.030 for CCL5). The effect on
CCL3 mRNA levels was higher compared to CCL5 induction (Fig. 2F).

3.2. Adiponectin lowers abundance of chemokine receptors on the cell
surface

Surface abundance of CCR1, CCR2, and CCR5 was analysed by
flow cytometry and representative results are shown in Fig. 3A.
In monocytes of four different donors incubated with adiponectin
for 24 h surface levels of CCR1 were not altered (Fig. 3B). CCR2
and CCR5 were significantly reduced when monocytes of six differ-
ent donors were analysed and CCR2 was significantly more sup-
pressed than CCR5 (Fig. 3B). When monocytes of three different
donors were preincubated with the CCR2 receptor antagonist RS-
102895 for 2 h adiponectin-mediated downregulation of CCR2
was abrogated (Fig. 3C). Further, this antagonist significantly re-
duced surface CCR2 abundance (Fig. 3C). Chemokine receptor pro-
tein was analysed in the cell lysates of monocytes of 10 donors
(Fig. 3D and data not shown) and were not reduced upon adiponec-
tin incubation (Fig. 3E). Chemokine receptor mRNA expression was
determined in monocytes of eight different donors and was not
significantly changed (Fig. 3F).

3.3. Chemokine levels in cells of normal-weight, overweight, and type
2 diabetes patients

Chemokine levels were also measured in the supernatants of
monocytes isolated from the blood of normal-weight controls
(NW, 10 donors), overweight donors (OW, 12 donors), and T2D pa-
tients (11 donors) (Table 1). The levels of CCL2, CCL3, and CCL5
were all increased in cells of OW and T2D probands compared to
NW (Fig. 4A, B and D). CCL5 was even higher in the supernatants
of T2D compared to OW cells (Fig. 4D). CCL4, however, was simi-
larly concentrated in the supernatants of all of these cells
(Fig. 4C). Because chemokine levels were highly variable the
log(10) levels were used for further calculations and a positive cor-
relation of logCCL2 (r = 0.576, p < 0.001), logCCL3 (r = 0.578,
p = 0.001) and logCCL5 (r = 0.686, p < 0.001) but not logCCL4
(r = 0.217, p = 0.225) with BMI was identified (Fig. 4E–H). Further-
more, levels of all chemokine were correlated to each other even
when adjusted for BMI (Table 3) but not to systemic adiponectin
concentrations (data not shown).

3.4. Effect of adiponectin on chemokine levels in cells of normal-
weight, overweight, and type 2 diabetes patients

The effect of adiponectin to induce these chemokines was also
tested. Here, induction of CCL3 and CCL5 was significantly impaired
in monocytes of OW compared to NW donors (p = 0.009 for CCL3
and p = 0.036 for CCL5) and in cells of T2D compared to NW mono-
cytes (p < 0.001 for CCL3 and p = 0.006 for CCL5). Adiponectin-med-
iated upregulation of the chemokines was similar in OW and T2D
monocytes (Fig. 5A and B). The degrees of adiponectin-induced
upregulation of CCL3 and CCL5 showed a strong negative correlation
to BMI (r = �0.599, p < 0.001 for CCL3 and r = �0.399, p = 0.021 for
CCL5) and were positively correlated to each other (r = 0.668,
p < 0.001) suggesting that similar regulatory pathways are involved
(Fig. 5C and data not shown). The latter association was even highly
significant after adjusting for BMI (r = 0.638, p < 0.001). The degree
of adiponectin-induced upregulation of CCL4 was negatively associ-
ated with basal logCCL4 levels (r = �0.720, p < 0.001, Fig. 5D).
Upregulation of CCL2 by adiponectin was neither associated with
its basal levels nor BMI of the blood donors.

3.5. Chemokine levels in serum of normal-weight, overweight, and
type 2 diabetes patients

Chemokines measured in the serum of these probands (Table 1)
did not correlate with concentrations in the supernatants of the
respective monocytes (data not shown). Systemic levels of CCL2,
CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5 did not correlate with age, BMI, waist to
hip ratio, serum adiponectin or fasting glucose of the patients.
There was a modest positive correlation of systemic CCL3 and
CCL5 (r = 0.386, p = 0.026).

4. Discussion

In the current study we confirmed previous data showing that
adiponectin upregulates CCL2 in primary human monocytes
[20,32]. Further, induction of CCL2 mRNA is demonstrated suggest-
ing that transcriptional mechanisms are involved. Besides CCL2,
the mRNA and protein levels of the chemokines CCL3, -4, and -5
are also significantly induced by adiponectin. CCL2 is the ligand
of CCR2, CCL3 and CCL5 are ligands of CCR1 whereas CCL3, CCL4,
and CCL5 bind to CCR5 [1]. Neither mRNA nor total protein levels
of these receptors are altered by adiponectin incubation. However,
surface abundance of CCR2 is about 4-fold reduced and CCR5 is
about 2-fold lower in adiponectin incubated cells. CCR1 surface
levels are not reduced by adiponectin. Lower surface levels of at
least CCR2 seem to be secondary effects of ligand binding because
its downregulation by adiponectin is completely blocked by a CCR2
antagonist. Reduced numbers of cell-surface localized chemokine
receptors may desensitize those cells for further chemokine-asso-
ciated signaling events. Interestingly this antagonist significantly
lowers CCR2 surface levels in control- and adiponectin-incubated
cells.

Recently it has been shown that CCL2 upregulates CCR2 and
TGF-beta 1 mRNA in monocytes [27] but neither CCR2 nor TGF-
beta 1 (own unpublished data) expression are increased in the
adiponectin incubated cells. Cells studied herein were incubated
for 24 h with adiponectin whereas Sakai et al. mainly analysed
monocytes which were cultivated with CCL2 for 48 h, and shorter
incubation time used herein may partly explain these different
findings.

Although adiponectin levels have been found reduced in obesity
and metabolic syndrome [33,34] systemic concentration are similar
in the cohort analysed herein. Recent work has demonstrated high-
er adiponectin in patients with impaired renal function and adipo-
nectin has been identified to even predict an increased risk for
coronary heart disease [35,36]. Therefore, adiponectin levels are af-
fected by renal dysfunction and coronary heart disease and some of
the probands studied herein may have suffered from these compli-
cations. Further, the cohorts studied may have been too small to
demonstrate lower adiponectin in obesity and type 2 diabetes.

Adiponectin concentrations used in the in vitro studies herein
are four- to five-fold higher compared to median systemic levels
of the study cohort analysed. Dose–response curves demonstrate
a maximal effect when 10 lg/ml recombinant adiponectin is used.
When analysing primary cells varying basal chemokine levels and
distinct responses to adiponectin are expected. This led us to use

the most effective concentration of adiponectin to assure that the
cells of all donors respond to this adipokine. Several studies have
shown that effects of adiponectin are impaired in obesity and type
2 diabetes [30,37–40] and higher adipokine concentrations may be
necessary to stimulate the cells.

Impaired adiponectin-mediated upregulation of CCL3 and CCL5
is also detected in T2D and OW cells compared to NW monocytes.
The induction of CCL3 and CCL5 by adiponectin shows a strong po-
sitive correlation to each other and is even negatively associated
with BMI of the respective blood donors. These findings suggest
that monocyte CCL3 and CCL5 synthesis are similarly regulated
by adiponectin and this pathway is partly blocked by factors af-
fected in cells of overweight and obese blood donors. In addition,
a positive correlation of CCL3 and CCL5 levels is also found in the
monocyte supernatants and in serum of the blood donors.

CCL2 and CCL4 are similarly induced by adiponectin in the
monocytes of NW, OW and T2D patients. Whereas the induction
of CCL2 by adiponectin is not related to its basal levels or BMI of
the donors, a strong negative correlation of basal CCL4 and adipo-
nectin mediated upregulation of CCL4 independent of BMI has
been identified. This might indicate that monocytes with a higher
basal release of CCL4 are more resistant to adiponectin-mediated
upregulation of CCL4. However, neither the exact pathways in-
volved in adiponectin-induced chemokine induction nor the rea-
son for higher basal monocyte CCL4 synthesis have been
analysed so far and future studies are needed to evaluate the
underlying mechanisms.

The data discussed above indicate that different signal trans-
duction pathways are involved in the upregulation of the chemo-
kines studied herein. Furthermore, these data demonstrate that
there is no general resistance to adiponectin effects in state of
obesity or type 2 diabetes. In fact only specific signal transduction
pathways seem to be affected. Similar results have recently been
obtained in fat-loaded hepatocytes where only certain actions of
adiponectin are blocked [41].

Adiponectin binds to different receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2,
which are both expressed in monocytes [30,42] and signaling of

just one pathway may be disturbed in obesity. Various adiponectin
receptor downstream effectors including p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, AMP-
activated protein kinase and NFjB have been identified [42–44]
and activity of specific molecules may be differentially affected
in obesity.

Recently we described that LPS-induced release of these chemo-
kines is similar in monocytes of controls and T2D patients [11] sug-
gesting that anthropometrical and disease-related factors affect
only some pathways as described for adiponectin herein.

Basal levels of CCL2, CCL3, and CCL5 are all increased in the
supernatants of OW and T2D monocytes indicating that higher
synthesis is related to BMI and not to type 2 diabetes. Interestingly,
levels of these chemokines in the supernatants of the monocytes
correlates positively with BMI of the blood donors. CCL4, however,
is similarly abundant in all of the supernatants and not associated
with BMI.

None other than CCL5 is modestly higher in T2D cells compared
to monocytes of BMI-matched controls. CCL5 at least in serum has
been suggested to be involved in the development of T2D indepen-
dent of classical risk factors like BMI and dyslipidemia [12]. Low-
dose insulin infusion in T2D significantly reduces mononuclear cell
CCL5 but not CCL2 expression suggesting that impaired insulin
activity may contribute to increased monocyte CCL5 in T2D pa-
tients [45]. CCL5 and CCL2 serum levels are reduced upon insulin
infusion indicating that at least systemic CCL2 is not influenced
by its synthesis in mononuclear cells [45].

Levels of CCL2 and CCL5 have been found increased in serum of
type 2 diabetes patients when analyzing rather large cohorts
[9,12], and the low number of patient samples studied herein
may explain why this increase has not been confirmed. Further,
chemokines in serum do not correlate with the respective chemo-
kines in the monocyte supernatants. The chemokines analysed
herein are synthesized by various cells and tissues [46–48], and
therefore, it is unlikely that monocyte released protein consider-
ably affect systemic levels.

In summary this study shows that adiponectin stimulates syn-
thesis of CCL2 to CCL5 in primary human monocytes, and release
of CCL3 and -5 is impaired in obesity. Surface abundance of CCR2
and -5 is reduced in adiponectin-incubated monocytes suggesting
that this adipokine regulates CC-chemokine activity at the ligand
and receptor level.

Abstract

The effect of TNF-a on the renal NaþeKþ pump and the Naþ-Kþ2Cl� cotransporter was investigated in the rat. Animals were injected with
the cytokine, and 4 h later, a homogenate from the cortical and medullary tissues was prepared and used to assay the activity of the NaþeKþ

ATPase and the protein expression of the pump and symporter. TNF-a reduced the activity and expression of the pump in both cortex and
medulla, and its effect disappeared when animals were pre-treated with indomethacin, suggesting that TNF-a acts via PGE2. Higher levels
of PGE2 were detected by enzyme immunoassay, in kidney tissues isolated from rats treated with PGE2, thus confirming this hypothesis.
The cytokine also down-regulated the Na

cotransporter but this effect was not abrogated by indomethacin. PGE2, injected into
animals, exerted a dose-dependent effect. Low doses did not have any effect on the two transporters in the cortex while high doses inhibited
and down-regulated the pump and up-regulated the cotransporter. In the medulla low doses increased the activity and expression of the
pump but down-regulated the cotransporter while high doses exerted an exactly opposite effect on the two transporters. It was concluded
that the effect of TNF-a on the pump is mediated via PGE2 which is released at relatively high doses. The effect of the cytokine on the
cotransporter is, however, independent of PGE2.

1. Introduction

Tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a) is a pro-inflammatory
cytokine with a wide range of biological effects. It plays a cen-
tral role in shock due to sepsis [1,2] and has been implicated,
directly or indirectly, in the pathogenesis of renal failure [3,4].

The cytokine is released by the thick ascending limb of the
loop of Henle in rats challenged with LPS, and was shown to
exert cytotoxic effects and interfere with ion transport mecha-
nisms across epithelia [5]. Dogs infused with TNF-a had
marked nartriuresis and polyuria [6].

Since one of the major functions of the kidney is the regu-
lation of body fluid osmolality and electrolyte balance, TNF-a

may be altering renal functions by targeting electrolyte trans-
port processes along the nephron and interfering with the ac-
tivity of the transporters involved. The NaþeKþ ATPase
also known as the NaþeKþ pump is a key transporter that
regulates the activity of many others. It is a highly conserved
integral membrane protein, which couples ATP hydrolysis to
Naþ and Kþ transfer across the plasma membrane against their
electrochemical gradient [7]. By establishing Naþ and Kþ gra-
dients across the cell membrane, it provides the driving force
for the activity of other transporters like the Naþ/Hþ and the
Naþ/Ca2þ exchangers and the Naþ-Kþ2Cl� cotransporter
that regulates, respectively, cytoplasmic pH, Ca2þ levels, and
cellular volume. The NaþeKþ pump also drives a variety of
secondary active transport processes in the nephron like those
involving amino acids and glucose reabsorption. The ATPase
is a heterodimer expressed in all the different segments of

the kidney tubules and is composed of two functional subunits:
a catalytic a subunit (w110e113 kDa) containing the binding
sites for ATP, sodium, potassium, phosphate and cardiac gly-
cosides [8] and a b subunit (w35e55 kDa glycoprotein)
needed for the activity of the enzymatic complex [9]. The
b subunit also facilitates plasma membrane localization and
is responsible for the early structural and functional matura-
tions of the a subunit in the endoplasmic reticulum [8]. Sev-
eral isoforms of both a and b subunits have been identified
and all of them are capable of forming functionally active en-
zymes [10]. They are expressed in different cell types contrib-
uting in each to multiple specialized properties [11]. The a1
and b1 subunits perform housekeeping functions, and are
highly expressed in the kidney. In the rat, their abundance is
highest in cortical and medullary thick ascending limbs of
the loop of Henle and the proximal convoluted tubule [12].

Another important transporter in the kidney is the
Naþ-Kþ2Cl� (NKCC) cotransporter which couples the move-
ment of 1Naþ with 1Kþ and 2 Cl�. The symporter uses the
potential energy released by the downhill movement of Naþ

and Cl� to drive the uphill movement of Kþ into the cell. Two
isoforms have been identified: NKCC1, present in the basolat-
eral membrane of a wide variety of secretory epithelia; and
NKCC2, present only in the medullary region of the kidney
[13,14], and localized to the apical membrane of the epithelial
cells [15]. In epithelia, the cotransporter is responsible for the
net transcellular Cl� movement from one side of the cell to the
other. By raising intracellular Cl� above electrochemical equi-
librium, it provides the driving force needed for Cl� exit on
the other side of the cell.

It is apparent that both the NaþeKþ pump and the
Naþ-Kþ2Cl� symporter play a crucial role in the regulation
of electrolyte movements across kidney tubules, and in the in-
direct maintenance of body fluid osmolality. The importance of
these two transporters incited us to investigate whether they
constitute target sites for TNF-a action. The aim of this work
was to study the effect of TNF-a on the NaþeKþ pump and
the Naþ-Kþ2Cl� (NKCC1 in particular) transporter in kidney
cells isolated from rats treated in vivo with the cytokine.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Animal treatment

Male SpragueeDawley rats (Rattus norvegicus) were used
and were handled all through in accordance with the Guide for
Laboratory Animal Facilities and Care, US Department of
Health, Education and Welfare.

Rats weighing around 250 g were injected i.p. with TNF-a
(170 ng/100 g body weight) 4 h prior to the beginning of the
experiment, or with different doses of PGE2 (21 and
0.37 mg/100 g BW) 15 min before the beginning of the
experiment. These time points were chosen based on a similar
work studying the effect of TNF-a in the rat distal colon
(unpublished data). When indomethacin was used, it was
injected i.p. (1 mg/100 g BW) 10 min before TNF-a. TNF-a
was dissolved in physiological saline. Ethanol and dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) were used as respective vehicles for
PGE2 and indomethacin. A similar volume of the vehicles
was injected into control rats.

To ensure that any observed effect is due to TNF-a and not due
to a contaminant like the lipopolysaccharide, TNF-a was heated
for 20 min at 70 �C and its effect on the pump was studied.

2.2. Preparation of kidney cortical and medullary
homogenates

Rats were anesthetized by i.p. injection of pentobarbital
(5 mg/100 g body weight) and their abdomen were opened
through a lateral incision. The intestine and stomach were
pushed aside to expose the left kidney for its perfusion with
Tris buffer (buffer A: 200 mM NaCl; 5 mM MgCl2$6H2O;
2 mM EGTA; 5 mM KCl; 200 mM TriseHCl, pH 7.4).
A heparinized catheter was introduced into the aorta just above
the level of the left renal artery to allow the infusion of the
buffer. The mesenteric artery and the right renal artery were
both ligated. The left renal vein was cut for drainage. The left
kidney was perfused for 10 min with Tris buffer at a rate of
5 ml/min until cleared from blood. The bleached kidney was ex-
cised, its capsule removed, cut longitudinally and small pieces
from the cortex and medullary tissues were then removed and
homogenized in Tris buffer for around 5 min with a polytron
(20 000e22 000 rpm) at 4 �C. Protease inhibitors were added
to the samples which were kept at �20 �C for later use.

2.3. PGE2 assay

Kidneys were isolated from animals treated with TNF-a.
Cortical and medullary tissues were immediately excised,
cut into small pieces, and homogenized in presence of
indomethacin at 4 �C to inhibit any additional PGE2 synthesis.
Total PGE2 (intracellular and extracellular) extraction and
assay were conducted using an enzyme immunoassay kit
from Amersham Biosciences (PGE2 Biotrak EIA system) fol-
lowing exactly the protocol described by the manufacturer.

2.4. NaþeKþ ATPase assay

A crude membrane homogenate was prepared by spinning
homogenized cells at 3300� g for 10 min at 4 �C. Membrane
homogenates were then diluted in Tris buffer (buffer A) to
a final concentration of 2 mg/ml protein and incubated for
30 min with saponin (0.02% final concentration) at room tem-
perature. After a pre-incubation at 37 �C for 10 min in the
presence or absence of ouabain (4 mM final concentration),
the reaction was initiated by addition of ATP to a final concen-
tration of 1.25 mM, and terminated after a 1-h incubation at
37 �C by addition of trichloroacetic acid (200 ml, 11%). The
amount of inorganic phosphate liberated was measured color-
imetrically according to the method of Taussky and Shorr [16],
and the activity of the enzyme was determined by measuring
the ouabain-inhibitable inorganic phosphate liberated.

2.5. Western blot analysis

Membrane proteins were quantified using the Bio-Rad
reagent and were equally loaded and resolved on 8% poly-
acrylamide gels, then transferred onto a PVDF membrane
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, 2000 Alfred Nobel Drive, Hercules,
CA 94547, USA) . Protein expression of b actin was used to
check the equal loading. The PVDF membrane was then
washed, blocked and incubated overnight at 4 �C with a rabbit
anti-NaþeKþ ATPase a-1 IgG (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake
Placid, NY 12946, USA), or with an anti-rat sodium potassium
chloride cotransporter antibody (Alpha Diagnostic Interna-
tional, TX, USA). Detection of the signal was by enhanced
chemiluminescence using luminol reagent (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology Inc., CA, USA).

Autoradiographs were analyzed by densitometry using
a Gel-Pro(2) Analyzer software. The intensities of the signals
are reported as a percentage of the control value.

2.6. Statistical analysis

Results are reported as mean� SEM. Statistical signifi-
cance was tested by a one-way analysis of variance followed
by a TukeyeKramer multiple comparison.

3. Results

3.1. Effect of TNF-a and indomethacin on the activity
and protein expression of the NaþeKþ ATPase

TNF-a decreased the protein expression of the NaþeKþ

ATPase in both kidney cortex and medulla (Fig. 1). This effect
did not appear when heated TNF-a was used. Indomethacin,
an inhibitor of COX enzymes, did not have any effect on the
expression of the pump and in its presence, the down-regulatory
effect of the cytokine did not appear.

The effect of TNF-a and indomethacin on the pump activ-
ity followed a similar trend. The cytokine reduced the ATPase
activity down to around 40% of its control value (Fig. 2). This
inhibitory effect disappeared, however, in the presence of
indomethacin.

3.2. Effect of heated TNF-a, TNF-a, and indomethacin
on the protein expression of the Naþ-Kþ2Cl�

cotransporter

The protein expression of the Naþ-Kþ2Cl� cotransporter
was not affected by indomethacin in both cortex and medulla
(Fig. 3), but was significantly reduced by TNF-a even in the
presence of indomethacin.

3.3. Effect of TNF-a on PGE2 levels in the kidney

TNF-a caused a significant increase in the level of PGE2 in
both kidney cortex and medulla (Fig. 4).

3.4. Dose-dependent effect of PGE2 on the activity and
protein expression of the NaþeKþ ATPase

Low doses of PGE2 (0.37 mg/100 g BW) injected into
animals up-regulated the pump in the kidney medullary cells
(Fig. 5) and increased its activity (Fig. 6), but were without
any effect on the ATPase in cortical cells (Figs. 5 and 6).
High doses (21 mg/100 g BW), however, reduced the activity
and protein expression of the NaþeKþ ATPase in both cortex
and medulla (Figs. 5 and 6).

3.5. Dose-dependent effect of PGE2 on the protein
expression of the Naþ-Kþ2Cl� cotransporter

In the cortex (Fig. 7), low doses of PGE2 did not have any
effect on the expression of the cotransporter while high doses
caused an up-regulation.

In the medulla (Fig. 7), PGE2 affected the protein expres-
sion of the cotransporter in a dose-dependent manner. The pro-
tein expression was reduced at low doses and increased at high
doses.

4. Discussion

This work demonstrated a TNF-a-induced decrease in the
activity and protein expression of the NaþeKþ pump in
both renal cortex and medulla. The decrease in activity was
ascribed to the reduction in the abundance of enzyme
molecules.

This effect did not appear, however, when the rat was pre-
injected with indomethacin, an inhibitor of COX enzymes,
suggesting that the effect of the cytokine is mediated through
PGE2. This hypothesis was further confirmed by the observed
increase in renal PGE2 levels induced by TNF-a, and sup-
ported by many other works reporting a PGE2-mediated effect
of TNF-a. The cytokine for example was reported in the liter-
ature to induce cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2) expression in pri-
mary cultures of the medullary thick ascending limb [17] and
increase PGE2 synthesis in mesangial cells [18] and bovine
chondrocytes [19].

Another effect of TNF-a demonstrated in this work was the
decrease in protein expression of the Naþ-Kþ2Cl� (NKCC)
cotransporter in the cortex and medulla (Fig. 3), an effect
that was not abrogated by indomethacin and which is not con-
sequently dependent on PGE2.

Two isoforms of the Naþ-Kþ2Cl� cotransporter (NKCC)
are known to be present in mammalian tissues: NKCC1 and
NKCC2 [20e24].

The isoform studied in this work is the NKCC1. A decrease
in the abundance of this cotransporter is expected to reduce the
transepithelial NaCl transport from the serosal to the mucosal
side into the tubular lumen, and may come as a consequence
of the TNF-a-induced decrease in the NaþeKþ ATPase activ-
ity which provides the driving force for this symporter. It is
also in line with the reported diuretic and natriuretic effects
of TNF-a [6].

TNF-a signaling is a very complex process. TNF-a can
activate mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), nuclear
factor kappa B (NF-kB), Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), prote-
ases, ceramides, and reactive oxygen species [25]. On the
other hand the Naþ-Kþ2Cl� is regulated by phosphoryla-
tion/dephosphorylation or changes in its gene expression
[26]. The abundance of the Naþ-Kþ2Cl� cotransporter in
the thick ascending limb of the kidney was found to be regu-
lated by vasopressin via a cAMP-mediated increase in the
transcription of its gene, which contains a cAMP regulatory el-
ement [27]. Recently, TNF-a was shown to reduce cAMP
levels by targeting the enzyme adenylate cyclase through
a mechanism involving NF-kB [28]. Thus in this study,
TNF-a may have down-regulated the cotransporter by reduc-
ing the basal level of cAMP, thus decreasing the transcription

of its gene which has a cAMP regulatory element. This path-
way, however, is still speculative and would need to be con-
firmed by future experimental work.

It can be concluded that TNF-a affects the pump and the
symporter via, respectively, PGE2-dependent and PGE2-inde-
pendent pathways.

Injection of the animals with a low dose (0.37 mg/100 g
BW) of the prostaglandin did not affect the activity nor the
protein expression of the NaþeKþ pump in the kidney cortex,
but increased both significantly in the medulla. A higher dose
(21 mg/100 g BW), however, reduced the ATPase activity and
protein expression in both cortex and medulla, and thus ex-
erted a similar effect to that observed with TNF-a. The results
suggest that the cytokine induces the release of PGE2 at levels
high enough to induce inhibition and down-regulation of the

pump. The decrease in pump activity correlated here again
very well with the decrease in its expression and was ascribed
to a reduction in the number of the ATPase molecules.

This dose-dependent response to the prostaglandin may be
attributed to the activation of different types of PGE2 receptors
(EP receptors) having different signal transduction pathways
and different affinities for the prostaglandin. EP1 receptors
are known to signal via an increase in intracellular calcium
[29e31] and are present in the collecting duct, increasing in
abundance from the cortex to the papillae [32]. They were
also detected in the nuclear envelope where they can regulate

gene expression [33]. Activation of these receptors was shown
to inhibit renal Naþ and water reabsorptions and contributes to
natriuresis and diuresis. EP2 and EP4 are coupled to a Gs pro-
tein and cause an increase in cAMP levels [34,35]. EP2 recep-
tors exhibit a low level of expression in the kidney and their
precise localization is uncertain [36] while EP4 was detected
in the collecting duct [32] and in the glomerulus [37].

EP3 receptors are expressed in the medullary thick ascend-
ing limb and collecting duct. When activated they inhibit
cAMP generation via Gi [33] and are consequently expected
to exert an opposite effect to that of EP2 and EP3.

Many hormones and mediators are known to exert a long-
or a short-term regulatory effect on the NaþeKþ ATPase.
Short-term regulation usually involves changes in the kinetics
of the enzyme or its translocation between the plasma mem-
brane and intracellular stores. Protein kinases, mainly PKC
and PKA, were shown to play a major role in this regulation.

In the kidney, inhibition of the sodium pump in proximal
segments of the nephron was reported to be mediated through
G protein-linked PKC-dependent pathways [38,39], whereas
in distal segments, PKA-associated pathways are involved
[40,41]. Activation of the pump by PKA in the renal proximal
tubule was demonstrated to be secondary to an increase in its
translocation to the plasma membrane [42]. Similarly inhibi-
tion of the pump was shown to come as a consequence of
its phosphorylation by PKC at Ser-23 [43e45].

In some cases PKA was shown to regulate the pump indi-
rectly by altering the activity of other Naþ transporters and
consequently intracellular Naþ which in turn leads to a change
in the ATPase activity [46].

It has also been suggested [47] that phosphorylation of the
rat NaþeKþ ATPase at Ser-23 by PKC requires prior phos-
phorylation by PKA at Ser-943.

In this work EP1 and EP4 are suspected to mediate the effect
of high doses of PGE2 because they have a lower affinity for the
prostaglandin than EP3 [35] and activate, respectively, PKC
and cAMP signaling which have been shown to inhibit both
Naþ and water reabsorptions in the thick ascending limb of
the loop of Henle and the collecting duct [48]. EP3 may be in-
volved in the up-regulatory effect PGE2 observed at low doses
in kidney medulla due to its higher affinity for PGE2 and its
mechanism of action which involves a decrease in cAMP pro-
duction resulting in an increase in Naþ transport [36].

Different doses of PGE2 also exerted a dual trend on the
expression of the Naþ-Kþ2Cl� symporter. Low doses had no
effect in the cortex while high doses caused an up-regulation
of the cotransporter. In the medulla down-regulation was
observed at low doses while an opposite increase in the sym-
porter expression was observed at high doses. Thus, at all
doses studied, the effect of PGE2 on the cotransporter was
opposite to its effect on the pump. When the pump was
down-regulated and inhibited, the cotransporter was up-
regulated and vice versa. The two transporters are thus work-
ing in concert to regulate NaCl uptake from the tubular lumen
and consequently water. The opposite effect observed at high
doses may come as a form of negative feedback mechanism,
or a way by which the same mediator can be used, depending
on its level to exert opposite effects on salt reabsorption
depending on body needs.

The activity of the Na+/K+ ATPase was shown to be reduced during apoptosis and enhanced during cell
proliferation. This work investigated whether TNF-a exerts also opposite effects on the Na+/K+ ATPase
in HepG2 cells and whether these effects are time-dependent. A time response study demonstrated that
the activity and protein expression of the ATPase are decreased at 1 h and increased at 4, 6 and 8 h. This
work focused on the up-regulatory 4 h-response. TNF-a was shown to exert a stimulatory effect on cJNK
and NF-jB and an inhibitory effect on caspases which, in the basal state, down-regulate the ATPase. The
cytokine was found to target the caspases by activating JNK which in turn activates NF-jB. The activated
transcription factor inhibits the caspases and frees the ATPase from their inhibitory action leading thus to
its up-regulation.

1. Introduction

Tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine
with numerous biological properties ranging from inflammation to
proliferation, differentiation, and cancer growth. It plays a central
role in shock due to sepsis and wasting syndromes due to a variety
of cancers [1]. It is also involved in different physiological and
pathophysiological conditions [2]. In the liver it was described to
act as a ‘‘two-edged sword” [3], exerting both apoptotic and anti-
apoptotic effects.

These antagonistic effects were ascribed to the multiple and
complex signaling pathways activated by the cytokine. Caspases,
nuclear factor kappa B (NF-jB), Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) [4],
proteases, ceramides, and reactive oxygen species, were all found
to mediate TNF-a action. While activation of NF-jB was found cru-
cial for cell survival, activation of caspases was deemed essential
for the apoptotic process. The role of JNK is however still contro-
versial promoting both apoptotic and anti-apoptotic responses [5].

Apoptosis was found to be accompanied by changes in the lev-
els of Na+, K+ , and Cl� , and a decrease in the activity of the Na+/K+

ATPase also known as Na+/K+ pump [6], a ubiquitous transporter
responsible for the establishment of the trans-membrane Na+

and K+ gradients. In a previous work we studied the 1 h effect of
TNF-a on the Na+-/K+ ATPase in HepG2 cells. The activity of the
ATPase was found to be modulated by JNK, which stimulated the

yeh).
caspases and inhibited NF-jB, resulting in a net inhibition of the
pump, and probably favoring the apoptotic pathway [7]. Since
TNF was reported also to promote cell proliferation in hepatocytes
[8], we speculated that these antagonistic responses may be due to
differences in the period of action of the cytokine. TNF-a may be
activating different mediators at different time intervals leading
to opposite effects.

This work aimed at testing this hypothesis and determining the
mechanism of action of the cytokine.

2.2. Methods

2.2.1. Culture and treatment of HepG2 Cells
HepG2 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS,

1% Penicillin and streptomycin, in a humidified incubator (5% CO2)
at 37 �C. When 70–80% confluence was reached, the cells were
starved overnight and treated next day.

Dose and time response studies were conducted by treating the
cells with different doses of TNF-a (5, 10, 40, and 100 ng/ml) for
4 h, and with 100 ng/ml of TNF-a for different time periods (1, 2,
3, 4, 6, and 8 h). The involvement of caspases, JNK and NF-jB
was studied by pre-treating the cells with their respective specific
inhibitors FK009 (4 lM) ([9], SP 600125 (50 lM) [10] and PDTC
(100 lM) [11] . FK009 was added 15 min before TNF-a, while PDTC
and SP 600125 were added 30 min before the cytokine.

At the end of the incubation period, HepG2 cells were washed,
lysed, homogenized with a polytron at 4 �C and 20,000 rpm, and
preserved at �20 �C for later use after addition of protease inhibi-
tors. Proteins were quantified using the Biorad assay.

2.2.2. Western blot analysis
Equal amounts of protein were loaded and resolved on 8% poly-

acrylamide gels, and were transferred to PVD F membranes. The
membranes were then blocked and incubated with a primary
Na+/K+ ATPase a1 antibody, followed by a secondary IgG conju-
gated to horseradish peroxidase. Detection of the signal was by en-
hanced chemiluminescence. Equal loading was checked by
Ponceau staining, a rapid and reversible staining method for visu-
alizing protein bands on Western blots.

2.2.3. NF-jB activity
Activation of NF-jB by TNF was investigated by examining the

degradation of its inhibitory subunit IjBa. The expression of IjB
was studied by western blot analysis as described above using 10%
polyacrylamide gels and an anti-IjBa monoclonal antibody with a
goat anti-mouse secondary IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase.

2.2.4. Na+/K+ ATPase activity assay
Homogenates of HepG2 cells were suspended in Tris buffer

(1300 mM NaCl, 200 mM KCl, 40 mM MgCl2 and 150 mM histidine;
pH 7.4) to a concentration of 2 mg/ml. Saponin (1%) was then
added at a ratio of 1:4 and the samples were incubated at room
temperature for 30 min. Aliquots (50 ll) were then drawn and
incubated at 37 �C for 30 min, in presence or absence of ouabain
(3.75 mM final concentration), a specific inhibitor of the ATPase.
Adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) (7.5 mM final concentration) was
then added and the samples were incubated for an additional
30 min at 37 �C. At the end of the incubation period, an equal vol-
ume of trichloroacetic acid (11.5%) was added to stop the reaction,
and the samples were spun at 3000g for 5 min. The amount of
inorganic phosphate liberated was measured colorimetrically
according to the method of Taussky and Shorr [12]. The enzymatic
activity was determined by measuring the ouabain inhibitable
inorganic phosphate (Pi) released. The percent inhibition of the
enzyme activity was calculated as follows:

repeated three times.
2.2.5. c-Jun N-terminal kinase activity
A ‘‘KinasesStar JNK activity assay kit” was used to measure JNK

activity according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly JNK
was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and its activity deter-
mined using recombinant c_jun as a substrate. Phosphorylation
of c-Jun was detected by western blot analysis.
2.2.6. Statistical analysis
Results are reported as means ± SE and are tested for statistical

significance by a one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) followed
by Tukey–Kramer multiple comparisons test using Instat and Excel
Analysis softwares. The results were considered significant at
P < 0.01.
3. Results

3.1. Time and dose response studies on the effect of TNF-a on the Na+/
K+ ATPase in HepG2 cells

TNF-a at 100 ng/ml reduced the activity and protein expression
of the Na+/K+ ATPase at 1 h, and enhanced them at 4, 6 and 8 h
(Fig. 1a). The most prominent increase was observed at 4 h and
was maintained till 8 h (P < 0.001). This is why all further studies
were conducted at 4 h. The effect on pump’s expression followed
the same pattern as the effect on the pump’s activity (Fig. 1b).

A dose response study was then conducted to see if the effect of
the cytokine on the pump is concentration-dependent. The activity
of the Na+/K+ATPase was significantly increased in starved cells
treated for 4 h with 40 and 100 ng/ml TNF-a and unchanged at
lower doses (5 and 10 ng/ml) (Fig. 1c).

Since the up-regulatory effect observed at 4 h opposed what
was found previously at 1 h, we decided to investigate the 4-h re-
sponse and the signaling pathways involved.

3.3. Mediators of the late (4 h) effect of TNF-a on the Na+/K+ ATPase in
HepG2 cells

3.3.1. Involvement of JNK and NF-KB
At 4 h, TNF decreased the expression of IKBa (Fig. 2a) and in-

creased significantly the phosphorylation of c-jun (Fig. 2b) reveal-
ing an activation of NF-jB and JNK by the cytokine.

The involvement of NF-jB and Jun Kinase in the late (4 h) re-
sponse was studied by using their respective inhibitors PDTC and
SP600125.

PDTC alone had no effect on the expression and activity of the
pump but abrogated completely the effect of TNF-a (Fig. 3a and
b). The ATPase was down-regulated by SP600125 and in its pres-
ence the up-regulatory effect of TNF was significantly reduced
(Fig. 3a and b).

3.3.2. Involvement of caspases
To determine whether TNF-a signaling is mediated through

caspases, HepG2 cells were treated with FK009 a general caspase
inhibitor. The inhibitor FK009 alone, increased both the activity
and protein expression of the pump, exerting thus a similar effect
to the one observed with TNF-a (Fig. 4a and b). The up-regulatory
effect of TNF still appeared in presence of FK009 i.e. when caspases
were inhibited.

are significantly different from each other. P < 0.01.
3.3.3. Effect of different combinations of inhibitors on the protein
expression and activity of the Na+/K+ ATPase at 4 h

When both jun Kinase and NF-jB were inhibited concurrently
with their respective inhibitors SP600125 and PDTC, a decrease
in the activity and protein expression of the Na+/K+ ATPase was ob-
served (Fig. 3a and b). This decrease still appeared in presence of
the cytokine.

The up-regulatory effect exerted by FK009 was reduced in pres-
ence of PDTC (Fig. 5a and b), but in their simultaneous presence the

full effect of TNF-a on the ATPase activity and expression was
maintained (Fig. 5a and b).

Treating the cells with SP 600125 and FK009 concurrently did
not lead to any change in the activity or protein expression of
the pump (Fig. 6a and b). The up-regulatory effect of TNF-a still ap-
peared in their presence.

Cells treated with the three inhibitors, FK009, SP600125 and
PDTC, simultaneously, did not show any change in their Na+/K+
ATPase activity or protein expression. However in their presence
the effect of TNF was abrogated completely (Fig. 7a and b).

Table 1 summarizes the effect of the different mediators on the
pump.

4. Discussion

TNF-a is known to activate different mediators and signaling
pathways that culminate in either cell survival or cell death. Acti-
vation of the caspase cascade leads to apoptosis [13], while activa-
tion of NF-jB, induces genes having anti-apoptotic effects. Many
works demonstrated that apoptosis is accompanied by a reduction
in the activity of Na+/K+ ATPase in various experimental models
while stimulation of the ATPase was found to accompany liver
regeneration [14]. Although many isoforms of the enzyme are
known to exist, the a1 isoform is the one present in hepatocytes
[15].

4.1. Time and dose response studies

TNF acted on the Na+/K+ ATPase time-dependently (Fig. 1a).
Changes in the ATPase activity and protein expression followed a
similar trend (Fig. 1a and b), suggesting that changes in activity
are due to changes in the number of ATPase molecules. To deter-
mine whether these opposite responses are also dose-dependent,
cells were treated with different concentrations of TNF-a for
4hrs. At 4 h, TNF-a at doses equal or higher than 40 ng/ml exerted
a stimulatory effect on the ATPase (Fig. 1c). Since an increase in
pump’s activity was reported to occur during liver regeneration
[16], it can be speculated that TNF promotes at 4 h cell survival.

The mechanism underlying the early inhibitory response was
studied in a previous work [8]. This work is an attempt to unravel
the signaling mechanism behind the 4 h-response.

4.2. Signaling mediators

4.2.1. TNF stimulates NF-jB
Inhibition of NF-jB with PDTC abrogated completely the effect

of TNF-a. The results imply that the effect of TNF-a on NF-jB is
stimulatory because had it been inhibitory, then PDTC would have
imitated the effect of TNF-a and an up-regulatory effect would
have been observed.

4.2.2. TNF stimulates JNK
Treating the cells with SP600125 (a specific inhibitor of JNK)

abrogated only partially the effect of TNF-a (Fig. 3a and b) suggest-
ing the presence of additional mediators that contribute to the ef-
fect of TNF on the pump. JNK should be stimulated by the cytokine
as was the case with NF-jB and for the same reasons mentioned
above for NF-jB.

4.2.3. TNF inhibits caspases
The up-regulatory response to TNF-a still appeared in presence

of FK009 (Fig. 4a and b), indicating that either caspases are not in-
volved in TNF action, or if they are, they are inhibited by the cyto-
kine. In the latter case, caspase inhibition should imitate the effect
of TNF-a and this is in fact what was observed when FK009 was
added alone (Fig. 4a and b). Addition of TNF-a simultaneously with
FK009, lead to a similar response to the one observed with each
one separately, inferring that caspases are part of the signaling
pathway activated by TNF or else an additive effect would have
been observed.

It can be concluded that TNF-a acts via stimulation of NF-jB
and JNK, and inhibition of caspases. No additional mediators are in-
volved in TNF signaling, since when cells were treated with the
cytokine in presence of inhibitors of all three mediators the effect
of TNF-a disappeared completely (Fig. 7a and b).

4.3. Positions of the signaling mediators in the pathway

4.3.1. JNK is upstream of NF-jB
It is apparent from the above that caspases, in the basal state,

exert an inhibitory effect on the activity and protein expression
of the Na+/K+ ATPase (Fig. 4a and b).

The effect of JNK is however stimulatory since a down-regula-
tion was observed when it was inhibited with SP 600125. Inhibi-
tion of NF-jB did not have any effect on the pump, suggesting
that the transcription factor is not involved in its regulation in
the basal state.

The fact that the effect of FK009 was abrogated partially with
PDTC but fully with PDTC + SP600125, suggests that NF-jB and

JNK activate two different pathways that stimulate the pump. It
can be postulated that the basal activity of the Na+/K+ ATPase is a
balance between two stimulatory pathways mediated via JNK
and NF-jB, and an inhibitory pathway mediated via caspases.
When caspases are inhibited, the stimulatory effect of JNK and
NF-jB becomes apparent. When caspases and NF-jB are inhibited
concurrently, the up-regulatory effect is reduced because it be-
comes restricted only to the one caused by JNK. However when
JNK and caspases are inhibited concurrently, leaving only NF-jB
active, no change is observed in the ATPase activity and expression.
As the up-regulatory effect of NF-jB was not observed in this case,
it can be postulated that it is activated by either JNK or caspases.
Since the effect of FK009 disappeared partially in presence of PDTC
but fully in presence of SP600125 and SP600125 + PDTC, it can
safely be concluded that JNK is upstream of NF-jB and causes its
activation.

When JNK and NF-jB were inhibited simultaneously (Fig. 3a
and b), leaving only the caspases active, down-regulation of the
pump was observed. This confirms the inhibitory effect of caspases
on the ATPase, an effect that was not counterbalanced anymore, in
this case, by the stimulatory effect of JNK and NF-jB.

4.3.2. JNK is upstream of caspases
The effect of TNF was abrogated partially in presence of

SP600125 alone but reappeared in the simultaneous presence of
FK009 and SP600125. It can be speculated that TNF-a inhibits
the caspases via activation of JNK, freeing thus the ATPase from
their down-regulatory effect. The data indicate also that JNK is up-
stream of caspases.

4.3.3. NF-jB is upstream of caspases
Inhibition of NF-jB with PDTC abrogated the effect of TNF and

although JNK is still active, no up-regulation was observed because
it was counteracted by an inhibition caused by active caspases.
However, TNF effect reappeared upon simultaneous inhibition of
NF-jB and caspases, implying that when NF-jB is active, it inhibits
caspases and is upstream of them.

When JNK and NF-jB are inhibited concurrently, the ATPase is
down-regulated by TNF-a because the caspases remain active and
are not inhibited by NF-jB.

The cytokine could not exert its effect in presence of inhibitors
of all three mediators since all stimulatory and inhibitory path-
ways are blocked. The results infer that no additional mediators
are involved in the response to TNF-a.

4.4. Signaling pathway of TNF-a

It can be concluded that TNF-a acts via stimulation of JNK and
NF-jB, and inhibition of caspases. NF-jB is upstream of the casp-
ases and inhibits them while JNK is upstream of NF-jB and acti-
vates it and is itself activated by TNF-a. TNF activates also NF-jB
but this activity is considerably enhanced by JNK. Fig. 8 represents
the postulated signaling pathway underlying the effect of TNF-a on
the Na+/K+ATPase at 4 h.

4.5. Possible implications of the up-regulatory effect of TNF-a on the
Na+/K+ATPase: roles of the mediators

Up-regulation of the pump by TNF-a is suggestive of an anti-
apoptotic state. In fact, in liver regeneration, the activity of the
Na+/K+ATPase was found to be increased [17,7] and NF-jB acti-
vated [7].

The anti-apoptotic effect of NF-jB in hepatocytes has been very
well documented and its cytoprotective function has been reported
by many studies in various cell types [18–23]. Mice deficient in NF-
jB activation have been shown to be more susceptible to hepato-
carcinogenesis [24]. By activating NF-jB, the cytokine induces a
number of anti-apoptotic genes, including c-FLIP, cIAP1, cIAP2, A1,
A20, TRAF1, and TRAF2 [5].

On the other hand caspases have been well recognized as key
mediators of apoptosis and cell death [25,26]. Since an anti-apop-
totic state prevails at 4hrs, the observed inhibition of caspases is
expected.

The role of JNK is however till now highly controversial. Many
works correlated activation of JNK with cell death. The kinase
was shown to play a central role in mediating the TNF-induced
apoptotis in hepatocytes [27,28] and developing embryonic fore-
brain [29,30]. Other studies however, did not find any association
between JNK and cell death [31].

In this work JNK activation seems to have an anti-apoptotic role,
promoting cell survival and proliferation. These findings are in line
with those reporting a role of JNK in oncogenesis [32–34].

The TNF-induced activation of JNK observed in this work is
needed to activate in turn NF-jB. One possible mechanism by
which the kinase could activate the transcription factor would
be by phosphorylating directly or indirectly IjB kinase (IKK)
leading to its activation. IKK would in turn phosphorylate the
inhibitory protein IjB on serine residues [34] targeting it for ubiq-
uitination and subsequent degradation, and leading consequently
to NF-jB activation [18]. Active NF-jB then inhibits caspases.
Such an effect has been demonstrated before in fibroblasts by Tang
et al. [35].

It can be concluded that TNF-a exerts a time-dependent dual
and opposite effect on the pump. The early 1 h response is inhibi-
tory and suggestive of an apoptotic state while the later response
at 4 h is stimulatory and suggestive of cell survival conditions.
Although in both responses JNK is activated and is the key player,
yet it exerts opposite effects on its targets namely NF-jB and
caspases which mediate, respectively, cell survival and apoptosis.
Caspases are active at 1 h but become inhibited at 4 h. The intrigu-
ing question that needs to be addressed is why is there a transient
and early activation of caspases that is followed by inhibition? Is
this a step in preparation for the anti-apoptotic state that will ap-
pear at 4 h? Su et al. [36] demonstrated previously that a defi-
ciency in caspase 8 abolished the activation of NF-jB induced by
antigen receptors, Fc receptors, or Toll-like receptor 4 in T, B, and
natural killer cells, ascribing thus a role for caspases in the activa-
tion of the transcription factor. It would be plausible then to as-
sume that here again, the early and transient activation of
caspases aims at triggering the activation of NF-jB which in turn
would shut them down.

Abstract

A group of transcription factors, termed signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs), appears to orchestrate the down-
stream events propagated by cytokine/growth factor interactions with their cognate receptors. Similarly, cytoplasmic Janus kinases
(JAKs) seem to play a critical role in diverse signal transduction pathways that govern cellular survival, proliferation, differentiation
and apoptosis. In this work, we analysed the effects of the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium porins on signaling by the JAK/
STAT pathway and IL-6 release in U937 cells. Porins and LPS of membrane from Gram-negative bacteria are factors implicated in septic
shock. In our assays porins induce interleukin-6 (IL-6) release (110 ± 2.6 pg/ml) 24 h after stimulation and STAT1/STAT3 tyrosine
(Tyr701/Tyr705) and serine (Ser727) phosphorylation after 15 min. By using several selective inhibitors we demonstrate that porins mod-
ulate the activation of STAT1/STAT3 through mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and not JAKs. Furthermore, we demonstrat-
ed that STAT1 and STAT3 are not involved in the modulation of IL-6 release in U937 cells stimulated with porins. Inhibition of
tyrosine/serine phosphorylation mediated by MAPKs of STAT1 and STAT3 decrease the IL-6 secretion following porin stimulation.
Therefore, suggesting a key role of this pathway in phosphorylation of Ser 727 in STAT1 and STAT3. These results are confirmed
by porin or LPS-induced nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT3 in U937 cells.

immunogens, on coming into contact with cells of the
inflammatory and immune responses, induce the produc-
tion of peptide and small peptide mediators such as cyto-
kines, defensins, etc., which have different structures and
functions. The molecular mechanisms which regulate the
interactions of the small peptide mediators with host cells
are well known, whereas there is little understanding of
the mechanisms by which different bacterial products
induce similar responses, releasing cytokines and defensins
[6].

Porins from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium,
Mannheimia haemolytica and Haemophilus influenzae
induce tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins in
THP-1 cells and in macrophages from C3H/HeJ mice [7].

Among the most prominent tyrosine phosphorylated
bands in porin-stimulated cells there are a number of pro-
teins with molecular masses similar to those of the tyrosine/
serine/threonine protein kinase family. Mitogen-activated
protein kinases (MAPKs) and their upstream kinases
activate a number of transcription factors and induce tran-
scription from a variety of inflammatory genes in response
to LPS and cytokines [8]. MAPKs are kinases that signal
the intracellular responses to an array of extracellular stim-
uli that include mitogens, growth factors, pathogen-derived
products, and other physical stressors.

Additionally, porins activate the Raf-1-MEK1/2-MAPK
pathway and transcriptional factors AP-1 and NF-jB [9].

The family of transcription factors called STATs (signal
transducers and activators of transcription) have been
found to be activated by the Janus kinases (JAKs) that
are associated with the cytokine receptor components
[10]. In resting cells the STATs, when phosphorylated by
the JAKs, dimerize via their SH2 domains and translocate
to the nucleus, where they interact with specific DNA
sequences and transactivate the associated genes.

The ability of STATs to homo-or-hetero-dimerize
allows cytokine-specific cellular responses [11]. Several
polypeptide ligands use the JAK-STAT molecules in signal
transduction [12]. Four JAKs have been identified in mam-
mals: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and Tyk2. They have molecular
masses ranging from 120 to 140 kDa and a conserved struc-
ture with distinct regions. Two JAKs of the same or differ-
ent class must be in close proximity for phosphorylation to
occur. Seven STAT proteins have currently been identified
in mammalian cells, with molecular masses between 75 and
95 kDa. Many different models have been used to investi-
gate the role of JAK/STAT in response to infection in vivo
[13]. The models range from polymicrobial peritonitis [14]
and Klebsiella pneumoniae lung infection [15], to intraperi-
toneal injection of pathogens or their components, such as
endotoxin [16].

In the present study, we investigated the ability of por-
ins to directly activate the JAK/STAT signal transduction
pathway and stimulate IL-6 release from U937 cells. The
results will contribute to our current knowledge on the
mechanism and function of JAK/STAT signaling in
sepsis.
2. Materials and methods

2.1. Cell lines

U937 monocytes (ATCC CRL-1593.2) were grown at
37 �C in 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 and differentiated as pre-
viously described [17]. Cells were tested every 2 weeks by
a PCR-based detection assay for mycoplasma contamina-
tion [18].

2.2. Bacterial strain

The bacterial strain used was S. enterica serovar
Typhimurium SH5014 grown in nutrient broth for 18–
24 h at 37 �C under agitation; cells were harvested at the
end of the exponential growth phase.

2.3. Preparation of porins and LPS

Porins were isolated from the lysozyme–EDTA extract-
ed envelopes of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain
SH5014 as previously reported [9]. The protein content of
the porins preparation was determined by the method of
Lowry et al. [19] and checked by SDS–PAGE according
to Laemmli [20]. SDS–PAGE revealed two bands with
molecular weights of 34 and 36 kDa, confirming the purity
of the preparation. LPS was isolated using the phenol/chlo-
roform/ether method described previously [9]. All possible
traces of LPS were revealed on SDS–PAGE stained with
silver nitrate as described by Tsai and Frasch [21] and by
the Limulus-amoebocyte-lysate assay (Limulus test, pbi
international, Milan Italy) according to Yin et al. [22].

2.4. Cell stimulation with S. enterica serovar Typhimurium

porins and LPS for preparation of cell lysates

U937 cells (3 · 106 cells/ml) were stimulated with differ-
ent concentrations (1, 5 and 10 lg/ml) of stimuli for differ-
ent time periods (15, 30 and 60 min) in 96-well
polypropylene plates. After incubation, the cells were pre-
pared as previously reported [9] and used for enhanced
chemiluminescence’s (ECL) Western Blot analysis.

2.5. Kinase phosphorylation

Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated and used for wes-
tern blotting. Immunoprecipitation was carried out with
the appropriate antibodies (anti-JAK1, -JAK2, -JAK3,
-Tyk2, -STAT1, -STAT2, -STAT3, -STAT4, -STAT5,
-STAT6) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Blots were
blocked for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline
(TBS [150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5]) contain-
ing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma–Aldrich
S.r.l., Milano, Italy) plus 1% blotting grade blocker
non-fat milk (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and subsequently
membranes were washed twice with TBS containing
0.05% Tween 20 (TTBS) before incubation for 1 h at room

temperature with anti-phosphoaminoacid monoclonal
antibodies (anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-phosphoserine or
anti-phosphothreonine antibody; Calbiochem, Novabio-
chem Corporation, GmbH) diluted in TBS containing 1%
BSA. After being washed six times with TTBS for 3 min,
PVDF membranes were incubated at room temperature
for 2 h with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG HRP secondary
antibodies diluted 1:3000. They were then washed six times
with TTBS and twice with PBS for 5 min. In some
experiments, the same blot was used for detection of
p(Tyr701)STAT1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.),
p(Tyr705)STAT3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Inc.), p(Ser727)STAT1 Upstate Biotechnology (Lake
Placid, NY), p(Ser727)STAT3 (New England BioLabs),
p(Tyr1007/1008)JAK2 Upstate Biotechnology (Lake
Placid, NY) and p(TyrTyr1054/1055)Tyk2 (Cell Signaling
Technology Inc., Beverly, MA) after stripping of the previ-
ous antibody with Restore Western blot stripping buffer
(Pierce).

2.6. Cytokine release

All assays were carried out using 3 · 106/ml U937 cells
stimulated with different concentrations of stimuli (5 lg/
ml of porins or 1 lg/ml of LPS) for 24 h at 37 �C in 5%
CO2; the time points and concentrations have been deter-
mined in preliminary experiments as that giving maximum
release. After incubation the samples were centrifuged at
1800 rpm at 4 �C for 10 min and the supernatants were
collected and stored at �70 �C. IL-6 release was measured
by ELISA using pair-matched monoclonal antibodies,
according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (Roche
Diagnostic SpA, Milan, Italy).

2.7. Inhibitors of signal transduction

In some experiments, before stimulation, U937 cells were
pretreated with PD-098059 (New England Biolabs, Inc.), a
selective inhibitor of MEK1 activator [23]; SB203580 (Cal-
biochem, Novabiochem Corporation, GmbH), a specific
inhibitor of the p38 pathway [24]; AG490 (Calbiochem–
Novabiochem Corp., CA), a specific JAK inhibitor [25];
H7, a serine/threonine kinase inhibitor [26]; genistein, a
broad-range tyrosine kinase inhibitor [27] for 60 min.

2.8. STATs trans-activation analysis

To detect and quantify STATs activation in U937 cells,
we used ELISA-based Trans-Am transcription factor kits
(Active Motif, Carlsbad, USA) that exploited a patented
technology to attach an oligonucleotide containing the
STAT consensus binding site (5 0-TTCCCGGAA-3 0) to a
96-well plate according to the transcription factors ana-
lysed [28]. The active form of STAT contained in cell
extract specifically binds to this oligonucleotide. The pri-
mary antibodies used to detect STAT recognize an epitope
on STAT1, STAT3, STAT5A or 5B that accessible only
when the STAT is activated and bound to its target
DNA. Preparation of nuclear cell extracts was done
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The specific-
ity of the assays was checked by measuring the ability of
soluble wild-type or mutated STAT oligonucleotide to
inhibit binding. In preliminary assays, the Trans-Am kits
showed a good correlation with an EMSA in detecting
the DNA binding capacity of STATs. The optimal time
of stimulation (1 h) and amount of porins (5 lg/ml) or
LPS (1 lg/ml) used in the STAT ELISA were determined
in preliminary experiments.

2.9. Endotoxin test

All materials and solutions were tested for LPS by a
Limulus test as described by Yin et al. [22]. The results of
this test was compared with a standard LPS solution which
was Limulus test positive at 0.1 EU/ml.

2.10. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay

LDH assays were carried out according to manufactur-
er’s instructions using a cytotoxicity detection kit (Roche
Diagnostic SpA, Milan, Italy).

2.11. Reproducibility

Gels were scanned for densitometry analysis by Sigma
Gel software (Sigma–Aldrich S.r.l., Milano, Italy). The
results shown are from a single experiment typical of at
least three giving similar results. The results were expressed
as mean values ± standard errors of three independent
observations. Comparisons between cytokine test was done
by Student’s t-test, with statistical significance considered
to P 6 0.01 and P 6 0.05 for STATs trans-activation
analysis and densitometry analysis of band intensity.

3. Results

3.1. Purity of porin preparations

The purification of the porin preparation and the even-
tual contamination by LPS have been amply discussed in
previous works [29,30]. Using the Limulus test, the LPS
contamination in the porin preparations, used in this study,
was estimated to be <0.005% (w/w) compared with a stan-
dard S. enterica serovar Typhimurium LPS solution. The
concentration of porins used in our experimental proce-
dures, contains a biologically insufficient percentage of
LPS (about 50 pg/lg of porins), which did not induce
any enzyme phosphorylation or cytokine release.

3.2. Porin and LPS induce release of IL-6 in U937 cells

It has been extensively documented that porins have the
ability to stimulate the synthesis and release of pro- and
anti-inflammatory cytokines [31].

Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium porins (5 lg/ml
or 0.2 lM) induced IL-6 production (110 ± 2.6 pg/ml) 24 h
after stimulation, representing at least 60% of the produc-
tion obtained with 1 lg/ml (0.5 lM) of LPS (Fig. 1). Time
points chosen for IL-6 production were previously opti-
mized (data not shown). Porin-mediated IL-6 induction
by U937 cells is not affected by adding the specific LPS-in-
hibiting oligopeptide Polymyxin B (PMB) (Sigma–Aldrich
S.r.l., Milano, Italy) (10 lg/ml) [32] to porins prior to stim-
ulation, while LPS-mediated stimulation was abolished in
the presence of PMB. This confirms that IL-6 induction
by porins in U937 cells is not due to contamination by
LPS (data not shown).

3.3. JAK/STAT phosphorylation by porins

In order to examine the role of JAK/STAT signaling
pathways for IL-6 release induced by porins in U937 cells,
we performed Western blot analyses of JAK/STAT activa-
tion. U937 cells were treated with either porins (5 lg/ml) or
LPS (1 lg/ml). The time points and concentrations chosen
for phosphoaminoacid analysis of JAKs and STATs were
previously optimized (data not shown). The extracts were
examined for the presence of tyrosine phosphorylated
JAKs, and threonine, serine or tyrosine phosphorylated
STATs by Western blot analysis.

LPS stimulation induced rapid tyrosine phosphorylation
(1 min, optimal stimulation time) of JAK2 (Tyr1007/1008)
and Tyk2 (Tyr1054/1055) corresponding to about 80% and
50% of signaling induced by interferon (IFN)-c (100 U/ml)
(Roche Diagnostic SpA, Milan, Italy) used as positive con-
trol of JAK/STAT activation [12]. On the other hand LPS
stimulation resulted in no detectable tyrosine phosphoryla-
tion of JAK1 or JAK3 (Fig. 2).

Following 1 min stimulation (optimal stimulation time)
with S. enterica serovar Typhimuirum porins, we could
not observe any significant immunoprecipitation band
using anti-JAK1, anti-JAK2, anti-JAK3 or anti-Tyk2
antibodies for tyrosine phosphorylation analysis (Fig. 2).

Western blotting analysis of protein extracts derived
from U937 cells treated for 15 min with either porins
(5 lg/ml) or LPS (1 lg/ml) revealed several STAT phos-
phorylated proteins (Fig. 3). The time points and concen-
trations chosen were previously optimised. The lysates
obtained were immunoprecipitated by antibodies that spe-
cifically recognised STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4,
STAT5 or STAT6 enzymes. Immunoblot analyses were
performed using anti-phosphothreonine, anti-phosphoser-
ine or anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. After stimulation
with porins or LPS, tyrosine phosphorylation levels of
STAT1 (Tyr701) or STAT3 (Tyr705) were comparable to
levels obtained using IFN-c (Fig. 3a). Serine phosphoryla-
tion analysis of STATs showed immunoprecipitation
bands with anti-STAT1 and -STAT3 antibodies (Fig. 3b).
The levels of STAT1 (Ser727) serine phosphorylation were
comparable after stimulation with porins, LPS or IFN-c.
The immunoprecipitation with anti-STAT3 followed by
anti-phosphoserine immunoblotting demonstrated a
marked increased serine phosphorylation (about 70%
respect to IFN-c) after LPS stimulation. Porin stimulation
induced an evident serine phosphorylation of STAT3
(Ser727) (about 56% respect to IFN-c).

No phosphorylation of STAT threonine residues was
detected after porins or LPS stimulation (data not shown).

When the immunoprecipitating antibodies used were
specific for STAT2, 4, 5 or 6 no bands were observed for
analysis of threonine, serine or tyrosine residue phosphor-
ylation after porin or LPS stimulation (data not shown).

The specificity of the effect was demonstrated using a
different protein (BSA) as a stimulus; no phosphoryla-
tion of the proteins investigated in our study was
observed. The possibility that traces of LPS contaminat-
ing the preparation of porins could be responsible for
the observed effect can be excluded. The minimum con-
centration of LPS able to induce phosphorylation of
STAT1 and STAT3 in our in vitro model is 100 ng/ml,
which is much more than the quantity of LPS present
in our preparation (about 50 pg/lg of porins) (data not
shown).

3.4. Effect of inhibitors on STAT1 and STAT3 tyrosine/

serine phosphorylation in U937 cells stimulated by porins

Since JAKs are not involved in phosphorylation induced
by porin, to further examine the signaling pathways
involved in STAT1 and STAT3 tyrosine and serine phos-
phorylation by porins, we investigated if other signaling
pathways are involved in both STAT1 and STAT3 phos-
phorylation in response to a porin stimulus. We tested
the effect of different inhibitors: PD-098059 (inhibitor of
MEK1 activator and MAPK pathway), SB203580 (inhibi-
tor of p38 pathway), AG490 (JAK inhibitor), H7 (serine/
threonine kinase inhibitor) (Fig. 4).

The immunoprecipitated proteins for JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and Tyk2 were separated by electrophoresis, transferred to PVDF membrane and probed with
Abs specific for anti-phosphotyrosine. In some experiments, the same blot was used for detection of p(Tyr1007/1008)JAK2 and p(Tyr1054/1055)Tyk2
after stripping of the previous antibody. Gels were scanned for densitometry analysis with the Sigma Gel Software, and the ratio of the value for each
stimulation time to the value for an unstimulated control is shown. The data are averages from three different experiments, and the error bars indicate the
standard errors of the means. Band intensity was quantified densitometrically. *P 6 0.05 indicates statistically significant difference compared to IFN-c
stimulated cells.

Cells were pretreated for 60 min with PD-098059
(25 lM) and then stimulated with either porins or LPS.
From cell lysates a decrease in intensity of the immunopre-
cipitation bands with anti-STAT1 or anti-STAT3 antibod-
ies for tyrosine phosphorylation analysis was observed.
Using porins the decrease in intensity of the immunopre-
cipitation bands with anti-STAT1 or anti-STAT3 antibod-
ies for tyrosine phosphorylation (Tyr701 and Tyr705,
respectively) analysis was about 35% (Fig. 4a) and using
LPS it was about 40% (Fig. 4b).

Pretreatment with SB203580 (10 lM for 60 min) prior to
stimulation with porins or LPS resulted in a considerable
decrease in intensity of STAT1 and STAT3 immunoprecip-
itation bands for tyrosine phosphorylation analysis. The
intensity of the bands was reduced of about 50% with
either porins or LPS.
When using AG490, at a concentration of 10 lM for
60 min, we could not observe any change in the immuno-
precipitated bands for tyrosine phosphorylated of STAT1
or STAT3 after stimulation with porins (Fig. 4a), while
LPS reduced activation of about 20% (Fig. 4b). The cell
pretreatment with H7 (25 lM for 60 min) modulated both
porin or LPS-induced STAT1 and STAT3 tyrosine phos-
phorylation. For maximal transcriptional activity, STAT1
and STAT3 need to be phosphorylated on both tyrosine
and serine residues [33]. To verify STAT1 and STAT3 ser-
ine phosphorylation, U937 cells were pretreated with PD-
098059, SB203580 or H7 prior to the addition of porins
or LPS. The results, presented in Fig. 5, indicate that
PD-098059, reduced the phosphorylation status of STAT1
or STAT3 serine (about 30% for porins and 35% for LPS)
as well as the pretreatment with SB203580 (about 50% for

for 15 min. The immunoprecipitated proteins for STAT1 and STAT3 were separated by electrophoresis, transferred to PVDF membrane and probed with
Abs specific for phosphotyrosine (a) and phosphoserine (b). In some experiments, the same blot was used for detection of phosphorylated forms of
STAT1(Tyr701), STAT3(Tyr705), STAT1(Ser727) and STAT3(Ser727) after stripping of the previous antibody. Gels were scanned for densitometry
analysis with the Sigma Gel Software, and the ratio of the value for each stimulation time to the value for an unstimulated control is shown. The data are
averages from three different experiments, and the error bars indicate the standard errors of the means. Band intensity was quantified densitometrically.

porins and 42% for LPS); the inhibitor H7 completely
abrogated serine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3
induced by porins or LPS stimulation.
These data suggest that activation of MAPK by porins
or LPS is required for modulation of maximal STAT1
and STAT3 activation.

3.5. Porin-induced nuclear translocation of STAT1 and

STAT3

Experiments investigate the dimerization by porin or
LPS-activated STAT1 and STAT3 and the concomitant
nuclear translocation of dimers in U937 cells were carried
out. The results obtained showed that increased specific
binding of active STAT1 or STAT3 (Fig. 6) were detected
in U937 lysates 1 h after stimulation with porins (5 lg/ml)
or LPS (1 lg/ml).

Further experiments were performed to ascertain
whether MAPKs had a role in the binding of STAT1 and
STAT3 to DNA by porins. Specifically, we looked at the
effects of the PD-098059, SB203580, AG490 and H7 inhib-
itors on binding of STAT1 and STAT3 to a consensus
binding site. PD-098059 pretreatment was effective in
decreased STAT1 or STAT3 porin or LPS-mediated nucle-
ar translocation (about 37% for porins and about 45% for
LPS). The pretreatment with the p38 inhibitor SB203580
decreased porin or LPS stimulated STAT1 or STAT3 bind-
ing to DNA (50%), suggesting that the functionality of
these proteins requires the activation of p38 pathway. Fur-
thermore, the results presented in Fig. 6, indicate that
AG490, had a decreasing effect on STAT1 and STAT3
DNA binding induced by LPS (22%). On the contrary,
no effect was evidenced on STAT1 or STAT3 nuclear
translocation following porin stimulation.

We finally investigated the effect of H7 on the induction
of porin- or LPS-mediated nuclear translocation of STAT1
or STAT3. Treatment of U937 cells with H7 partially sup-
pressed porin or LPS induction of STAT1 binding to a
consensus binding site (30%) (Fig. 6). Moreover, H7 pre-
treatment caused an evident inhibition of STAT3 LPS-
mediated DNA binding (70%), while modulated the porin
effect on STAT3 nuclear translocation (Fig. 6).
3.6. MAPK and not JAKs are involved in IL-6 production in

U937 cells stimulated by porins

To further examine the signaling pathways involved in
IL-6 release by porins and LPS, U937 cells were incubated
with specific inhibitors of ERK1/ERK2 (PD-098059,
25 lM for 60 min), p38 MAPKs (SB203580, 10lM for
60 min), JAKs (AG490, 10 lM for 60 min), a serine/threo-
nine kinase inhibitor (H7, 25 lM for 60 min) or a total
PTKs inhibitor (genistein, 50 lM for 60 min) before being

STAT1 and STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to S. enterica
serovar Typhimurium porins or LPS. U937 cells (3 · 106/ml) were
incubated with PD-098059 (25 lM for 60 min, MEK1 inhibitor) (PD),
SB203580 (10 lM for 60 min, p38 inhibitor) (SB), AG490 (10 lM for
60 min, JAK/STAT pathway inhibitor) (AG) or H7 (a serine/threonine
kinase inhibitor, 25 lM for 60 min) and stimulated with porins (a) or LPS
(b) for 15 min. Western blot analysis on total cell extracts was performed
using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies after immunoprecipitation with
specific antibody anti-STAT1 or anti-STAT3. Western blot signals were
quantitated by Sigma Gel Software and reported as the ratio of the value
for each stimulation time to the value for an non-stimulated control. The
results shown are the average of three independent experiments, and the
error bars indicate the standard error of the means. Band intensity was
quantified densitometrically. *P 6 0.05 indicates statistically significant
difference compared with those from cells receiving stimuli alone.

challenged with either porins or LPS. The optimal concen-
trations of inhibitors were calculated according to 50%
inhibitory concentration (IC50) values and specificities
reported in literature [23–27]. As shown in Fig. 7, the
pretreatment with PD-098059 or SB203580 prior to
stimulation with either porins or LPS induced a modest
effect on IL-6 release. The pretreatment with both inhibi-
tors simultaneously caused a clear decrease in IL-6 release
after 24 h. The inhibitor AG490 modified slightly IL-6
release, confirming that porins did not activate the JAKs
pathway unlike LPS. The serine/threonine kinase inhibitor
(H7) or the broad-range tyrosine kinase inhibitor (geni-
stein) reduced markedly IL-6 release suggesting that tyro-
sine phosphorylation of STATs in this system involves a
tyrosine kinase other than JAK family members [34], and
that the action of the serine/threonine kinase inhibitor is
directed to a kinase required for incrementing activation
of other tyrosine kinases.

Moreover, treatments with these concentrations of
inhibitors did not significantly affect the basal level of IL-
6 secretion, strongly indicating that pharmacological
results in this study were not contaminated by non-specific
cell damage, as confirmed by LDH assay (data not shown).

4. Discussion

Many different models of sepsis have been used to inves-
tigate the role of STATs and JAKs in response to infection.
The results obtained using these models of infection have
all contributed to the current knowledge on the mechanism
and function of JAK/STAT signaling in sepsis [11]. LPS
and porins of Gram-negative bacteria are key factors impli-
cated in septic shock [31]. Our results from in vitro experi-
ments on U937 cells demonstrate a complex indirect
mechanism of STAT1 and STAT3 activation after stimula-
tion of cells with either porins or LPS. The treatment with
porins did not results in increase of JAK phosphorylation
although a significant increase in precipitation bands for
phosphotyrosine STAT1 and STAT3 was observed. Using
several inhibitors, we demonstrated that the activation of
STAT1 and STAT3 by porins can occur through the acti-
vation of MAPK and possibly other PTKs [34] but not
through JAK activation. In our experiments, both the
ERKs and p38 MAPK are involved in the activation of
STAT1 and STAT3 by porins or LPS, while STAT2,
STAT4, STAT5 and STAT6 did not demonstrate any acti-
vation under our experimental conditions. The amount of

Typhimurium porins or LPS. U937 cells (3 · 106/ml) were incubated with
PD-098059 (25 lM for 60 min, MEK1 inhibitor) (PD), SB203580 (10 lM
for 60 min, p38 inhibitor) (SB) or H7 (a serine/threonine kinase inhibitor,
25 lM for 60 min) and stimulated with porins (a) or LPS (b) for 15 min.
Western blot analysis on total cell extracts was performed using anti-
phosphoserine antibodies after immunoprecipitation with specific anti-
body anti-STAT1 or anti-STAT3. Western blot signals were quantitated
by Sigma Gel Software and reported as the ratio of the value for each
stimulation time to the value for an non-stimulated control. The results
shown are the average of three independent experiments, and the error
bars indicate the standard error of the means. Band intensity was
quantified densitometrically. *P 6 0.05 indicates statistically significant
difference compared with those from cells receiving stimuli alone.

stimulated with S. enterica serovar Typhimurium porins or LPS in the absence or presence of an ERK 1/2 inhibitor (PD-098059, 100 lM) (PD), or a p38
inhibitor (SB203580, 10 lM) (SB), or a JAK/STAT pathway inhibitor (AG490, 10 lM for 60 min) (AG) or a serine/threonine kinase inhibitor (H7, 25 lM
for 60 min). Cell lysates (10 lg/ml) were tested for binding of the activated STAT1 or STAT3 to an STATs consensus sequence using the Trans-Am
STATs family ELISA kit. The experiment was performed in the presence of soluble wild-type or mutated consensus oligonucleotides. The results are
expressed as specific binding (absorbance measured in the presence of the mutated oligonucleotide minus that measured in the presence of the wild-type
oligonucleotide). The results are shown as means ± standard errors of triplicate determinations (*P 6 0.05; Student‘s t-test).

phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 induced by porins
or LPS resulted in only a minor difference. Whereas LPS
appeared to be superior to porins with respect to induction
of STAT1/STAT3 activation by ERK1/ERK2 mediation,
porins induced significantly more phosphorylation of
STAT1/STAT3 and IL-6 release through p38. Moreover,
the pretreatment with H7 or genistein decreased IL-6 secre-
tion mediated by porins or LPS, indicating that both tyro-
sine kinases and serine/threonine kinases are essential for
IL-6 production. Although porins and LPS signal through
different surface receptors [35,36], our data show that there
are also differences between the tyrosine kinase signaling
pathways by which porins and LPS are able to activate
cells. Our results suggest that JAK2 and Tyk2 phosphory-
lation is only required for IL6 production LPS-induced,
but they are not required following porin-induction. This
lends weight to the hypothesis of a different cellular
mechanism exerted by porins in contrast to LPS, as also
described in previous works [9,30,35,36].

Previous studies have demonstrated that bacterial infec-
tion of macrophages, or treatment with LPS resulted in
rapid STAT1 phosphorylation in Serine727 independently
of concomitant tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 in
Tyr701 [10]. Serine and tyrosine phosphorylation of
STAT1 occur independently of each other, but the serine
kinase may recognize tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1
preferentially in the course of an IFN-c response [37]. Max-
imal activation of transcription by STAT1 and STAT3
require both tyrosine and serine phosphorylation [33].

serine/threonine kinase inhibitor, 25 lM for 60 min), genistein (a total PTKs inhibitor, 50 lM for 60 min). IL-6 level was measured by capture ELISA (see

tyrosine phosphorylation [28]. Cytokine- and growth fac-
tor-induced STAT activation is mainly dependent of JAKs
phosphorylation, while porins do not use these tyrosine
kinases. Our results show that STAT1 and STAT3, after
porin stimulation, are phosphorylated at tyrosine residues
(Tyr701 and Tyr705, respectively) probably through other
PTKs [34]; in fact treating cells with genistein, a wide spec-
trum inhibitor of tyrosine kinases, IL-6 release becomes
strongly reduced. Early post-receptor events in porins
and LPS induced signal transduction involve tyrosine
phosphorylation [7,38], but it is unclear which tyrosine
kinases are critically involved in the down-stream signal
transduction pathways. In addition to the tyrosine kinases,
a number of serine kinases was previously shown to be acti-
vated by porins and LPS, including c-Raf, the MAPKs
ERK1 and ERK2, the p38 kinase, c-Jun kinase [9]. Our
experiments also show serine (Ser727) phosphorylation of
STAT1 and STAT3. Moreover, MAPKs inhibitors reduce,
with a different extent, IL-6 release, pointing out a key role
of this pathway in phosphorylation of Ser727 in STAT1
and STAT3.

These results are confirmed by nuclear translocation of
STAT1 and in porin or LPS-stimulated U937 cells. Several
published data show that MAPKs have specific roles in
phosphorylation of Ser727 of STATs [39]. Porins and
LPS while not directly influencing the out-put of the
JAK/STAT signal transduction pathway, are able to play
an important role in the activation of macrophages as a
result of the stimulation with early cytokines release and
a previous stimulus such as a microbial product (e.g. por-
ins, LPS). Porins, as also LPS, activates also others tran-
scriptional factors such as AP-1 and NF-jB [9], that
plays a central role in the transcriptional activation of
numerous genes encoding immunologically and pro-in-
flammatory important cytokines or other mediators. In
our in vitro experiments we have not found evidence of
phosphorylation of STATs 2, 4, 5 or 6, although they are
dramatically modified in infection and especially during
sepsis [11]. The in vivo conditions which occur during sepsis
can probably not be reproduced in vitro, where we are able
to separate an immune response following a porin stimula-
tion from the whole response which is also influenced by
the released cytokines. In conclusion the results obtained
in this work demonstrate that signaling in cellular activa-
tion can be directly influenced by bacterial components
and that also early cytokines, released by the effect of the
same bacterial components, can interfere with signaling
pathways.

Correction

CELL BIOLOGY
Correction for “Shox2 is a molecular determinant of depot-
specific adipocyte function,” by Kevin Y. Lee, Yuji Yamamoto,
Jeremie Boucher, Jonathon N. Winnay, Stephane Gesta, John
Cobb, Matthias Blüher, and C. Ronald Kahn, which appeared in
issue 28, July 9, 2013, of Proc Natl Acad Sci USA (110:11409–
11414; first published June 24, 2013; 10.1073/pnas.1310331110).
The authors wish to note the following: “It has been brought to

our attention that the original Fig. 2D in our paper contained a
duplicate image in which the panel showing SCF from Shox2f/f mice
(Middle Left) was duplicated and also shown as PGF in F-Shox2−/−

mice (Bottom Right). In the corrected version of Figure 2D shown
below, we have replaced the duplicate image with the correct
original data. After careful re-examination of the original data, we
are confident that the error in assembling this figure does not affect
the validity of the research or the conclusions that we have drawn.
We are grateful to the careful reader who brought this mistake to
our attention and apologize for any confusion that this error may
have caused.” The corrected Fig. 2 and its legend appear below.

Fig. 2. F-Shox2−/− males are resistant to HFD-induced obesity. (A) Body weight
measurement of F-Shox2−/−and control animals during 12 wk on HFD (started at
6 wk of age). Data are shown as mean ± SEM of five to seven animals per group.
*P < 0.05 for all panels. (B) Weight of fat pads from F-Shox2−/− and control males
after 6 wk of HFD exposure. Data are shown as mean ± SEM (n = 4–5). (C) Ratio
of perigonadal (intraabdominal) fat/flank (s.c.) fat pad weights for F-Shox2−/−

and control males after 6 wk of HFD exposure. Data are shown as mean ± SEM
(n = 4–5). (D) Hematoxylin/eosin-stained representative sections from F-Shox2−/−

and control males after 12 wk of HFD exposure. Pictures were taken at 200×.
(E) Calculation ofmedian adipocyte size in perigonadal and s.c. fat from F-Shox2−/−

and control males after 12 wk of HFD exposure. Values represent median ± SEM
of five digital images from four animals per group. (F) Oxygen consumption rate
in the light and dark cycles of male F-Shox2−/− and control animals after 2 wk of
HFD feeding. Data are shown as mean ± SEM (n = 4). BAT, brown adipose tissue;
PGF, perigonadal fat; SCF, s.c. fat; VO2, oxygen uptake.

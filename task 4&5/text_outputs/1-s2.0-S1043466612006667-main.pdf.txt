Inflammatory responses of THP-1 cells (macrophage cell line) exposed to chrysotile asbestos (Chry) and
Libby six-mix (LIB) and the subsequent impact on bronchial epithelial cells were determined. Direct
treatment of THP-1 cells with Chry caused cell death, activation of caspase-1 and release of IL-1b, while
the addition of caspase-1 inhibitor, Z-YVAD-FMK, reduced IL-1b, suggesting that Chry activated the cas-
pase-1 mediated Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome; by comparison, LIB had less effects
on all of these parameters. Expression of antioxidant enzymes, protein oxidation and nitration, and lipid
peroxides in THP-1 cells treated with the two particles suggest that LIB generated more reactive oxygen
species (ROS) than the same dose of Chry. Differences in fiber length and surface area suggest a possible
role for particulate size in the differential activation of the inflammasome. BEAS-2B cells, representing the
bronchial epithelium, treated with supernatants of medium from Chry- or LIB-treated THP-1 cells (con-
ditioned medium) activated the MAPK cascade, increased phosphorylation of ERK and Cot (MAP3K8),
increased AP-1 binding activity and induced IL-6 release. To verify that IL-1b from THP-1 cells was
responsible for activation of BEAS-2B, conditioned medium with added IL-1Ra, an IL-1b antagonist,
was applied to BEAS-2B. Results show that IL-1Ra attenuated effects of conditioned medium, supporting
a role of IL-1b, as a secondary mediator, in the transduction of inflammatory signaling from the macro-
phage to epithelial cells. The effects of LIB-conditioned medium appeared to be less dependent on IL-1b.
In conclusion, Chry and LIB induce differential inflammatory responses in THP-1 cells that subsequently
lead to differential effects in epithelial cells.

lioma [1]. Inflammation plays a key role in lung injury, involving
different cell types, such as alveolar macrophages and bronchial
epithelial cells that initiate and/or sustain inflammatory processes.
Alveolar macrophages provide surveillance of the major bound-
aries between the body and the outside world. Macrophages are in-
nate immune cells with well-established roles in the primary
response to pathogens. These cells recognize danger signals
through receptors and activate specific signaling pathways [2].
The macrophage-like cell line, THP-1, has been shown to secrete
the proinflammatory cytokine, IL-1b, upon contact with crocidolite
asbestos [3–5]. Mature IL-1b is processed through cleavage of the
inactive pro-IL-1b precursor by caspase-1/ICE (IL-1b converting en-
zyme). Caspase-1 was the first caspase to be discovered in mam-
mals, but only recently has the pathway leading to its activation
been elucidated and shown to involve a series of large complexes,
called inflammasomes [6,7]. Stimulation of macrophages with
asbestos resulted in cell death and robust secretion of IL-1b in a
manner dependent on the Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3),

also called Nalp3 (NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing pro-
tein 3) inflammasome [3,4,8,9]. Previous reports have indicated
that macrophages from wild-type mice could undergo caspase-1-
mediated IL-1b maturation but macrophages deficient in the
NLRP3 inflammasome were incapable of secreting IL-1b [3,4,8].

Following the initiation of proinflammatory responses upon
exposure to asbestos with the release of cytokines, such as IL-1b,
alveolar macrophages often die and are cleared from the airway.
In contrast, neighboring bronchial epithelial cells can sustain path-
ogenic responses and lead to asbestos-related lung disease, even if
they may not be in direct contact with the asbestos fibers. IL-6 is
considered to be an important mediator of acute inflammation
[10] and implicated in the pathogenesis of particle-related lung
disease. The MAPK pathways contribute to epithelial cell prolifera-
tion, which is a major risk factor for the development of lung can-
cer or fibro-proliferative diseases [11,12]. Whether IL-1b secreted
by THP-1 cells affects the alveolar epithelium leading to cell prolif-
eration, inflammation and eventual fibrosis via MAPK-IL-6 path-
ways is uncertain although it is well established that direct
exposure of pulmonary epithelial cells [13], alveolar [14], and
bronchial epithelial cells [15,16] to asbestos leads to activation of
MAPK cascades and induction of ERK1/2 phosphorylation.

Several investigators have examined the interaction between
macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells, employing a co-culture
system (Transwell) in which two different cell types were sepa-
rated by a membrane with only macrophages exposed to the par-
ticles of asbestos or silica [17–19]. In the other compartment, the
epithelial cells were bathed by the same culture medium. Although
interesting connections were suggested, the underlying mecha-
nisms whereby primary responses of the macrophage initiated
and interacted with lung epithelial cells remain unclear. We have
investigated signal transduction from THP-1 macrophage-like cells
to BEAS-2B bronchial epithelial cells through a relatively simple
method: that is, to initially determine the inflammatory responses
of THP-1 exposed to different particulate fibers followed by collec-
tion of the supernatants of culture medium without any fibers
(termed as conditioned medium) in which BEAS-2B cells were then
grown and their responses assessed.

Asbestos occurs naturally and is composed of long thin fibers
broadly classified into two groups: serpentine and amphibole
[20]. Chrysotile asbestos (the asbestiform variety of the serpentine
group) is the most commonly used asbestos type in the US [21]. The
amphibole asbestos group consists of five mineral species: amosite,
crocidolite, tremolite, actinolite, and anthophyllite. The amphibole
asbestos occurring in the vermiculite mine near Libby, Montana, is
a mixture of several different species of amphiboles [22]. Several
research groups have studied this material, but the samples used
in the present work are a subset of those discussed in the publica-
tion by Meeker et al. [23] and morphologically characterized by
Bellamy and Gunter [24]. Bellamy and Gunter referred to the Libby
material as ‘‘six-mix’’. Because many of the studies examining the
pathogenic mechanisms related to aberrant cellular responses to
asbestos exposure utilized different forms of asbestos, the present
work contrasts the signal transduction pathways induced by chrys-
otile asbestos (Chry) and Libby six-mix (LIB). The role of IL-1b in the
THP-1-conditioned medium secreted in response to Chry or LIB
was compared and its subsequent effects on BEAS-2B immune re-
sponses, specifically IL-6 secretion, were examined.
2. Materials and methods

2.1. Cell culture

THP-1 cells: THP-1 cells from a human monocyte cell line were
grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS;
100 U/ml Penicillin/Streptomycin; 10 mM HEPES and 1 mM So-
dium pyruvate at 37.0 �C in 5% CO2. Cells from this monocytic cell
line require differentiation into cells with the functional character-
istics of mature macrophages [25,26], accomplished by treatment
with 100 nM PMA overnight and then refreshing the cells with
medium without PMA. BEAS-2B cells: BEAS-2B cells from the hu-
man bronchial epithelial cell line (ATCC) were seeded into flasks
or plates pre-coated with a mixture of 0.01 mg/ml fibronectin,
0.03 mg/ml bovine collagen type I and 0.01 mg/ml bovine serum
albumin in medium. The cells were grown in DMEM/F12 medium
(Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS; 100 U/ml of Penicillin/Streptomy-
cin, 1 lg/ml Insulin-Transferrin-Na selenite (Sigma), 1 lg/ml
Hydrocortisone (Sigma), and 10 mM HEPES at 37.0 �C in 5% CO2.

2.2. Chrysotile asbestos and Libby six-mix treatments

Chrysotile asbestos fibers (National Institute of Environmental
Health Sciences reference sample, NIEHS), and Libby six-mix (Uni-
ted States Geological Service, USGS) have been physically and
chemically characterized previously [21,24,27–30]. Glass beads
(GB) from Polysciences Inc. were used as a noncytotoxic particle
control [29]. The surface area of chrysotile measured using
Micromeritics Tristar equipment for nitrogen gas sorption analysis
by Happond Expander™ is reported to be 28.83 m2/g (Table 1). The
Chry and LIB fibers were sterilized under ultraviolet light overnight
prior to suspension in HBSS at 1 mg/ml, sonication for 15 min in a
water bath sonicator, and trituration eight times through a 22-
gauge needle before treatment of the cells [31]. Two mass-based
concentration systems have been commonly used in studies of
asbestos exposure: (1) mass concentration, which means the mass
of a constituent divided by the volume of a carrier and (2) mass-
per-area, which is the mass divided by the exposed surface area.
The asbestos suspensions were directly added to differentiated
macrophages or BEAS-2B cells in medium at a mass concentration
of 20 lg/ml and 40 lg/ml for 24 h, which was equivalent to mass
per area of 5 lg/cm2 and 10 lg/cm2 achieved by adjusting the vol-
ume of medium based on the surface area of the culture dishes. The
culture medium collected after exposure of THP-1 cells for 24 h
was centrifuged at the highest speed of an Eppendorf 5430R centri-
fuge with 50 ml-tube rotor. Then the supernatant of medium was
used to treat BEAS-2B cells and referred to as conditioned medium
with indicated asbestos concentration from the original THP-1
treatment. Since the conditioned medium contained no particles
and the cellular responses to GB or medium alone were similar, a
GB control was not included in the experiments using conditioned
medium.

2.3. Caspase-1 inhibitor treatments

A caspase-1 inhibitor VI, Z-YVAD-FMK (ZYF), was purchased
from BioVison and a caspase-1 inhibitor V, Z-D-CH2-DCB (ZD),
from Calbiochem. In preliminary experiments, 10, 20, 40 and
50 lM of inhibitors were applied to THP-1 cell 30 min prior to
asbestos treatment. After 24 h, the inhibitory effects on production
of IL-1b were compared, suggesting that ZYF was more efficient
than ZD. Based on these preliminary results, only 40 lM of ZYF
was used in the subsequent experiments.

2.4. IL-1b and IL-1Ra treatments

Recombinant human IL-1b protein and the antibody for cleaved
IL-1b were purchased from Cell Signaling. The IL-1 receptor antag-
onist (IL-1Ra) was purchased from Abcam. BEAS-2B cells were
challenged in preliminary experiments by 10, 20, 40, 80, and
100 ng/ml recombinant IL-1b to determine its effect on the secre-
tion of IL-6. The inhibitory effects of both IL-1Ra and anti-IL-1b

were also tested and compared. Based on the preliminary results,
only 400 ng/ml of IL-1Ra was used in the subsequent experiments
to treat BEAS-2B cells.

2.5. CytoTox-Glo™ Assay viability protocol

The CytoTox-Glo™ Assay (Promega) uses a luminogenic peptide
substrate (alanyl-alanylphenylalanyl-aminoluciferin; AAF-Glo™
Substrate) to measure dead-cell protease activity, which is released
from cells after loss of membrane integrity. The assay is primarily
designed to selectively detect dead cells; however, with the addi-
tion of the lysis reagent (provided in the kit), the CytoTox-Glo™ As-
say viability protocol (by lysis) can also deliver the luminescent
signal associated with the total number of cells. Cells were grown
and treated as described above and then trypsinized and passed
through the 40 lm mesh to break the clusters of cells and asbestos
fibers. The collected cells were then loaded into a 96-well plate and
the CytoTox-Glo™ Assay reagents applied to wells sequentially fol-
lowing the manufacturer’s protocol. The luminescent signals were
measured in a Synergy HT4 multi-detection microplate reader
(BioTek Instruments). Viability was calculated by subtracting the
luminescent signal resulting from experimental cell death from to-
tal luminescent values.

2.6. LDH cytotoxicity assay

The CytoTox 96� cytotoxicity assay is a colorimetric assay from
Promega. The assay quantitatively measures lactate dehydroge-
nase (LDH), a stable cytosolic enzyme that is released upon cell ly-
sis by treatments. Released LDH in culture supernatants was
measured after 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h treatments with an enzymatic
assay, which results in the conversion of a tetrazolium salt (INT)
into a red formazan product. The amount of color formed is propor-
tional to the number of lysed cells. Visible wavelength absorbance
data were collected at 490 nm with the Synergy HT4 (BioTek
Instruments). The results are expressed as a percentage of maxi-
mum LDH released from cells lysed by repeated freezing and
thawing.

2.7. Cytokine assays

Cells were grown and treated as described above; the culture
medium was then collected and centrifuged twice at 14,000 rpm
in an Eppendorf 5430R centrifuge with a rotor for 1.5 ml-tubes,
and the supernatants stored in �80 �C until analysis. Cytokines
and chemokines were analyzed using both Bio-Plex Pro™ Assay
(Bio-Rad) and Milliplex Map� Assay (Millipore). Bio-Plex-27 hu-
man cytokine kits were used in screening of cytokine responses,
while Milliplex Map� custom kits were used for selected cytokines.
The samples were prepared according to the manufacturer’s
instructions and run on the Bio-Plex suspension array system
(Bio-Rad). Standard curves were calculated and samples were ana-
lyzed using the Bio-Plex Manager software version 5 (Bio-Rad).
2.8. Caspase-1 FLICA assay

Z-YVAD-FMK caspase-1 FLICA kit was purchased from Immuno-
chemistry Technologies, LLC. The methodology is based on a fluo-
rochrome inhibitor of caspase-1, the FLICA reagent FAM-YVAD-
FMK, which enters the cells and binds covalently only to the active
caspase-1. The asbestos-treated THP-1 cells were trypsinized and
passed through the 40 lm mesh. 300 ll of each cell suspension,
which contained at least 1 � 106 cells, were transferred to sterile
tubes and incubated or washed sequentially with FLICA reagents
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The aliquots of cells were
then loaded into microtiter plate wells in different dilutions and
fluorescence read on a Synergy HT4 with excitation range from
488 to 492 nm, and emission range from 515 to 535 nm.
2.9. Western-blot analysis

The antibodies for total or phospho-ERK1/2, caspase-1, total or
phospho-NF-jB p65 (S536) were purchased from Cell Signaling;
the antibody for total Cot from Santa Cruz; the antibodies for phos-
pho-Cot (T290), b-actin and a-tubulin from Abcam Inc.; the anti-
bodies for MnSOD, GCLC from Abnova; the antibody for NLRP3
from AdipoGen; the antibody for 3-nitrotyrosine from Millipore.
Total or nuclear proteins were extracted from treated cells as de-
scribed previously [32]. The 20 lg of each total protein was elec-
trophoresed on 10% or 7.5% Mini-PROTEAN� TGX™ precast gels
(Bio-Rad) and then electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes.
After blocking the membranes with 1% BSA blocking/dilution buf-
fer, the membranes were incubated with the appropriate primary
antibody at the recommended concentration overnight with shak-
ing at 4 �C and then rinsed. After incubation with corresponding
secondary antibodies, the protein bands were visualized using a
SuperSignal™ West Pico Trial Kit (PIERCE) and exposed to radio-
graphic films. The images and densities were captured with a GS-
700 Imaging Densitometer (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA) and analyzed
with Quantity One Software Version 4.2 (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA).
The membranes were stripped and then reimmunoblotted with
another antibody or loading control: b-actin or a-tubulin antibody.
2.10. Oxidized protein detection

Protein carbonyl modifications were detected and quantified
using the OxyBLOT™ Assay (Millipore) according the manufac-
turer’s protocol. Briefly, BEAS-2B cells were treated with Chry
and LIB and protein lysates were incubated with 2, 4-dinitrophen-
ylhydrazine (DNPH). The DNP-derivative protein samples were
separated by SDS–PAGE followed by Western blotting. The same
membranes were stripped and then reimmunoblotted with b-actin
as a loading control.
2.11. Lipid and aqueous peroxides assay

Lipid and aqueous peroxides in THP-1 conditioned medium
were measured with the OxiSelect™ Hydrogen Peroxide Assay
Kit (Cell Biolabs, Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Peroxide in the medium converts Fe2+ into Fe3+, which reacts with
an equal molar amount in the presence of acid to create a purple
product that absorbs maximally between 540 and 600 nm. Sam-
ples were then reacted with xylenol orange in 96-well plate and
read on the Synergy HT4. The peroxide content in unknown sam-
ples was calculated by comparison with the predetermined H2O2
standard curve.

2.12. EMSA for AP-1

Double stranded AP-1 consensus oligonucleotides were pur-
chased from Promega. The probes were labeled with [c-32P] ATP
using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) according to the man-
ufacturer’s protocol. EMSA was performed as described previously
[33]. The 6 lg of nuclear extracts from BEAS-2B cells exposed to
Chry, LIB or 10 ng/ml of TNF-a were used in the binding assay;
1 ll of anti c-Fos antibody (Santa Cruz) were applied to supershift
the AP-1 complexes, respectively; cold AP-1 probes were also in-
cluded at 1:100 M ratios for probe competition.

2.13. Statistics

Values are presented as mean ± SEM for indicated numbers of
experiments, or mean ± SD for measurement with replicates. The
mean values are reported as a percentage of control. Comparisons
were performed using one way Anova (GraphPad). The p values
were considered to be significant if they were 60.05.

3. Results

3.1. Cell viability in response to asbestos exposure

Cell viabilities were assessed with the CytoTox-Glo™ Assay and
results shown in Fig. 1A and B. Differences between the two cell
lines were found in the responses to direct exposure of THP-1
and BEAS-2B cells to 20 or 40 lg/ml of Chry (Chry20, Chry40)
and LIB (Lib20, Lib40). After 24 h of exposure, Chry significantly re-
duced the survival of THP-I cells compared to control, whereas LIB
had less of an effect (Fig. 1A). No reduction of cell viability was
seen in BEAS-2B cells with the treatments compared to control;
however, cell number based on the CytoTox-Glo™ Assay slightly
increased with LIB treatments (Fig. 1B). To confirm the result from
Fig. 1A, a LDH cytotoxicity assay was used in THP cells treated with
Chry and LIB for 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h (Fig. 1C). Cell death gradually
increased with increasing exposure times. By 24 h, Chry40 had in-
duced significant cell death (�60%), with lesser degrees induced by
Chry20, LIB40 and LIB20. Together the data indicate selective cyto-
toxicity in macrophages exposed to asbestos compared to epithe-
lial cells.

3.2. IL-1b and caspase-1 responses in THP-1 cells

Cytokine and chemokine concentrations were measured in the
supernatant of the culture medium from treated THP-1 cells using
the human Bio-Plex array (see Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 for
complete set of data). IL-1b was the most prominently induced
cytokine. Fig. 2A shows the results of induction of IL-1b in 3 inde-
pendent experiments when THP-1 cells were treated with Chry
and LIB for 24 h. Chry20 induced a 4-fold and Chry40 a 6-fold in-
crease in IL-1b secretion compared to the control; whereas Lib40
induced IL-1b secretion by only 2.9-fold. Meanwhile GB and con-
trol resulted in similar levels of IL-1b. Other cytokines found to
be significantly induced included IL-1Ra, G-CSF and IL-2 (see Sup-
plementary Table 2).

The combination of cell death and IL-1b secretion suggested the
possible involvement of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. NLRP3
expression was hence determined by Western-blot and showed
that NLRP3 protein level was higher in all treatments compared
to control. However, none of treatments achieved statistical signif-
icance compared to control (Fig. 2B).

Pro-caspase-1, an assembling member of the inflammasome
complex, is proteolytically activated from a proenzyme to produce
two active subunits, p20 and p10, with p20 being identifiable by
immuno-blotting. Fig. 3A shows a representative blot and a sum-
mary of data obtained from three independent experiments. Re-
sults suggest that active p20 was induced by the Chry
treatments, especially Chry40, but to a lesser degree by LIB treat-
ments with no effect by GB. To further confirm the activation of
caspase-1 in Chry-treatments, the caspase-1 FLICA assay was per-
formed and the result revealed that Chry40 clearly increased cas-
pase-1 activity in the THP-1 cells (Fig. 3B).

The activation of caspase-1 and secretion of IL-1b are two
important consequences of inflammasome activation. To verify
whether blocking caspase-1 activation would reduce maturation
of IL-1b in macrophages, a caspase-1 inhibitor, Z-YVAD-FMK
(ZYF) was used in PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells and treated with
40 lg/ml asbestos. Application of ZYF showed a trend towards

the bar-graphs. � Indicates p 6 0.05 when comparing asbestos treatments with control. (B) NLRP3 expression in Chry and LIB treated THP-1 cells. A representative Western-

repression of active p20, although the inhibitory effect did not
reach statistical significance (Fig. 3A). Meanwhile, Fig. 3C shows
that IL-1b was significantly induced by Chry20 and Chry40 with
less effect of Lib40 and no effect of GB. ZYF significantly repressed
the Chry40 and Lib40 effects resulting in little IL-1b detectable in
the medium. These results suggest that IL-1b secretion in response
to asbestos is caspase-1 dependent.

3.3. Comparison of ROS production in Chry and LIB treated THP-1 cells

Oxidative stress is another potential mediator for particle-in-
duced inflammation in cells. Two antioxidant related enzymes,

superoxide dismutase (SOD) and c-glutamate cysteine ligase cata-
lytic subunit (GCLC), were selected as the indicators of oxidative
status since SOD expression is often low in the presence of oxida-
tive stress whereas GCLC expression is induced if cells are chal-
lenged by a reduction in GSH levels. Blake et al. have reported in
murine macrophages that internalization of LIB asbestos fibers
generated a significant increase in intracellular ROS, decreased
GSH levels, and impaired total SOD activity [34]. To clarify the oxi-
dative stress status in Chry- and LIB- treated THP-1 cells, the
expression of manganese SOD (MnSOD) and GCLC were compared
by Western blots. The upper panel of Fig. 4A shows protein blots of

lower bar-graphs summarizes MnSOD and GCLC expression in
three experiments. Induction of MnSOD was found in response to
Chry but not seen in GB and LIB-treated cells. Meanwhile, an in-
crease of GCLC was seen in LIB treated cells but there was little
in GB and Chry-treated cells. The difference between the responses
to Chry and LIB treatments suggests that the two particulates in-
duced oxidative stress to different degrees. Protein carbonyl mod-
ifications were then determined using the OxyBLOT™ Assay. A
representative blot (Fig. 4B) shows that THP-1 cells treated with
Lib40 displayed a dramatic increase in the number and degree of
oxidized proteins as compared to control, GB and Chry40-treated
cells. This suggests that more oxidative stress is generated by LIB
amphiboles compared to Chry. Reactive nitrogen species is another
indicator of oxidative stress. Protein tyrosine nitration in Chry- and
LIB- treated THP-1 cells was also compared and shown in a repre-
sentative blot in Fig. 4C. LIB induced more 3-nitrotyrosine forma-
tion than Chry treatments. Finally, the existence of lipid
peroxides in conditioned medium was evaluated with the OxiSe-
lect™ Hydrogen Peroxide Assay as shown in Fig. 4D. LIB treatments
resulted in more lipid peroxide in conditioned medium than Chry
treatments with most of the peroxide found in the lipid rather than
aqueous fraction. There was a significant difference between the
responses to Lib20 compared to Chry20.

3.4. Role of IL-1b in BEAS-2B responses to THP-1-conditioned medium

BEAS-2B cells were directly treated with Chry and LIB for 24 h.
The induction of IL-6 by direct exposure of epithelial cells to Chry
has been described elsewhere [17,35]; therefore in the present
work, Chry-40 was used as a ‘‘positive control’’. IL-6 was found
to be significantly induced by Chry40 and less so by Lib40 in di-
rectly treated BEAS-2B cells, as shown in Fig. 5A.

BEAS-2B cells were then grown in THP-1 conditioned medium
for 24 h as well. Because the IL-1b levels in GB-conditioned med-
ium was consistent with control, as described in Section 3.2, GB-
conditioned medium was not used in the conditionally treated
BEAS-2B cells. Several cytokines were found to be induced by con-
ditioned medium (see Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). The most
significant change occurred in IL-6 levels as shown in Fig. 5B. In
comparison to Fig. 5A, direct treatment with Chry40 induced a
4.8-fold increase of IL-6 compared to control; whereas the increase
in IL-6 by Chry40-conditioned medium was only 1.5-fold. The in-
crease in IL-6 by LIB-conditioned medium was less than seen with
Chry-conditioned medium. These data support the contention that
induction of IL-6 by THP-1 conditioned medium may be related to
IL-1b.

Activation of the MAPK cascade is a prominent finding in epi-
thelial cells directly treated with asbestos [16,36]. Recently, an-
other inflammatory protein kinase, Cot (cancer osaka thyroid
oncogene), which is also known as Tpl2 (tumor progression locus
2) or MAP3K8 and functions upstream of MAPK signaling has been
described [37]. BEAS-2B cells directly treated with Chry and LIB
particles showed increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and phos-
phorylation of Cot kinase at Tyr290 compared to control (see Sup-
plementary Fig. 1A and B). To determine whether conditioned
medium had the same stimulatory function as directly treated
BEAS-2B cells, activation of ERK and Cot was examined in BEAS-
2B cells treated with THP-1 conditioned medium. Fig. 6A shows
induction of P-ERK and P-Cot by Chry- and LIB-conditioned med-
ium, similar to effects seen in directly treated cells.

Since the transcription factor NF-jB has also been suggested to
play a key role in the regulation of IL-6 expression and IL-1b is
known to specifically induce phosphorylation of NF-jB p65 at
Ser536 [38], the phosphorylation status of NF-jB p65 at Ser536
was also examined in conditionally treated BEAS-2B cells. The re-
sults revealed that phosphorylation of NF-jB p65 at Ser536 was in-
duced by Chry40-conditioned medium (Fig. 6B). Activation of AP-1,
which is downstream of MAPK pathways, is another important fea-
ture of asbestos-treated epithelial cells. Thus, the binding activity
of AP-1 was compared by EMSA, as shown in Fig. 6C, and demon-
strated that the binding activity of AP-1 was augmented by both
Chry40 and Lib20 conditioned medium.

To determine if IL-1b itself could activate BEAS-2B cells to se-
crete IL-6 as it appears to have done with conditioned medium,
we treated cells with recombinant human IL-1b protein. IL-1Ra,
an antagonist protein of IL-1b, was also used in parallel to test its
effect on inhibition of IL-1b. Fig. 7A summarizes the IL-1b effect
on IL-6 secretion. Treatment of BEAS-2B with 10 ng/ml of IL-1b in-
duced �1.6-fold increase in IL-6 secretion compared to control, but
increasing the dose beyond 10 ng/ml did not show a dose-depen-
dent increase of IL-6 (data not shown). The effect of 100 ng/ml of
IL-1b on IL-6 was even lower than the effect of 10 ng/ml. This find-
ing is consistent with an effective dose in pharmacology (ED50)
where the ED50 of recombinant IL-1b is commonly reported to
be much less than 10 ng/ml. The IL-1Ra molecule is structurally re-
lated to IL-1b but has mutations rendering it incapable of forming a
complex with IL-1b/IL-1RI/IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-
1RAcP) [39]. IL-1Ra-treatment did successfully suppress IL-6
secretion.

Although BEAS-2B cells treated with conditioned medium did
not have direct contact with asbestos fibers, both direct and condi-
tioned medium treatments resulted in phosphorylation of MAPK
and secretion of IL-6. In addition, IL-1b itself can stimulate BEAS-
2B in the same manner. The component in the conditioned med-
ium that mediated the inflammatory message from THP-1 cells
to BEAS-2B cells is likely to be IL-1b. The specificity of the IL-1b ef-
fect in conditioned medium was hence tested by IL-1Ra to see
whether IL-1Ra competitively blocked IL-1b in the conditioned
medium and consequently affected the cellular responses of
BEAS-2B cells. BEAS-2B cells were treated with THP-1-conditioned
medium, in addition to Chry40 and Lib40 with or without 40 lM of
ZYF (Chry40, Chry40 + ZYF, Lib40, Lib40 + ZYF) for 24 h. 400 ng/ml
of IL-1Ra inhibitor was added to another set of Chry40- or Lib40-
conditioned media (Chry40 + IL-1Ra, Lib40 + IL-1Ra). Fig. 7B illus-
trates the corresponding changes in IL-6 by the Milli-Plex 2 Assay
done in triplicate. Conditioned medium of Chry40 + ZYF slightly
decreased IL-6; however, addition of IL-1Ra to Chry40-conditioned
medium had a much greater effect on the suppression of IL-6 re-
lease. In contrast, LIB treatments showed the same trends, but
none of the differences reached significance. Fig. 7C shows a repre-
sentative of Western-blots on the top and two summary graphs be-
low. Results in Fig. 7C indicates the same trend of the inhibitory
effects of IL-1Ra on the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Cot by
Chry40-conditioned medium.

In summary, both IL-6 and MAPK results demonstrate that
blocking of IL-1b leads to down-regulation of the effects of
Chry40-conditioned medium on BEAS-2B. This suggests that IL-
1b in Chry-conditioned medium is responsible for triggering
inflammatory responses in BEAS-2B cells. In contrast, blocking of
IL-1b appears to play a smaller role in the effects induced by LIB.

3.5. Comparison of cytotoxicity and inflammatory effects based on
matched surface area

We have compared the effects of Chry and LIB using mass con-
centrations of 20 and 40 lg/ml that is equivalent to mass-per-area
of 5 and 10 lg/cm2. To further evaluate whether the total surface
area (SA) of particles affected the respective responses, the other
approach which measures ‘‘the total surface area per unit of
cross-sectional area’’ was also examined. According to the refer-
enced SA values shown in Table 1, the SA of Chry is 28.83 m2/g, Lib-
by-6 mix is 5 m2/g, and the GB control is 3 m2/g. Two

concentrations of the total SA per area were selected that allow us
to compare them to the other concentrations used. One is
25 � 106 lm2/cm2, which is equivalent to a mass concentration
of 3.3 lg/ml Chry or 20 lg/ml LIB; the other is 150 � 106 lm2/
cm2, which is equivalent to mass concentration of 20 lg/ml Chry
or 120 lg/ml LIB. Cell viability and cytokine/chemokine secretion
were again compared. Fig. 8A and B illustrates cell viability result-
ing from the same total surface area of Chry and LIB fibers in per
cm2 of exposed THP-1 or BEAS-2B cells. Fig. 8A shows that both fi-
bers have a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on THP-1 cells but that
the effect of Chry150 was much greater than Lib150. Meanwhile,
Fig. 8B shows that both Chry and LIB induced similar trends in re-
sponses of BEAS-2B cells where both resulted in minimal cytotox-
icity of these cells. Fig. 8C and D compared the release of IL-1b by
THP-1 cells and IL-6 by BEAS-2B cells respectively. Although both
particles had shown similar trends of cytotoxicity, Chry elicited a
totally different inflammatory response than LIB. Release of IL-1b
in Fig. 8C was dramatically increased in Chry150 with an opposite
effect with Lib150, suggesting that Chry150 resulted in an inflam-
matory form of cell death with increased cytokines; whereas
Lib150 resulted in a cell death without inflammation. Similarly,
Fig. 8D shows that secretion of IL-6 for the Chry150 was also quite

different from Lib150. These data suggest that Chry had a much
greater effect on IL-1b and IL-6 secretion than LIB, which was inde-
pendent of matched total surface area.

4. Discussion

4.1. IL-1b acts as a secondary mediator

The present data elucidate the role of IL-1b in the primary re-
sponses of the macrophage and its interaction with epithelial cells
as follows: (1) when exposed to Chry and LIB, THP-1 cells under-
went a caspase-1 mediated inflammasome activation that resulted
in an inflammatory form of cell death which now known as pyrop-
tosis [40] and produced the proinflammatory cytokine, IL-1b; (2)
exogenous IL-1b treatment activated BEAS-2B and triggered
BEAS-2B inflammatory responses; (3) THP-1 conditioned medium,
containing secreted IL-1b, mimicked the effect of IL-1b treatment;
and (4) blocking IL-1b by IL-1Ra antagonist protein diminished the
effects of conditioned medium on BEAS-2B. Together, it appears
that the IL-1b in THP-1 conditioned medium acts as the secondary
mediator that stimulates the BEAS-2B immune response to Chry
and LIB.

However, activation of target cells by IL-1b is tightly regulated
at many levels, both extracellularly and intracellularly [39,41].
The extracellular regulation includes the presence of naturally
occurring inhibitors, such as the receptor antagonist, IL-1Ra. In
addition to the release of IL-1b, THP-1 cells also released IL-1Ra
simultaneously, as shown in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2. Thus,
the effect of endogenous IL-1b in THP-1 conditioned medium
was naturally restricted when it was applied to BEAS-2B cells. All
of these inhibitory effects could explain why a dramatic 10-fold
higher level of IL-1b in THP-1 conditioned medium treated with
Chry40 was limited to only 1.5-fold greater release of IL-6 by
BEAS-2B cells.

4.2. Chry and LIB differentially activate the inflammasome in THP-1
cells

In the present work, through comparison of THP-1 cells re-
sponses to Chry with LIB, we demonstrated that chrysotile asbestos
has more effect on the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome than
LIB. Although Fig. 2B did not show that the NLRP3 expression in
Chry treatments is higher than in LIB, activation of caspase-1 and
release of IL-1b were greater in Chry than LIB treatments. NLRP3
inflammasome activation has been defined as a rapid process in
which caspase-1 cleavage is induced. The process is independent
of upstream de novo transcription [42]. Cell priming through mul-
tiple signaling receptors that induce NLRP3 expression is necessary

but not sufficient for NLRP3 activation [43]. This priming can be
overcome solely by constitutive NLRP3 expression. Actually, mac-
rophages appear to express high levels of NLRP3 constitutively
and can bypass the requirement of NLRP3 expression [44,45].
Therefore, it is the activation of caspase-1, rather than expression
of NLRP3, that is a key indicator of activation of NLRP3 inflamma-
some in THP-1 cells.

Environmental toxicants (such as asbestos) and damage-associ-
ated molecular patterns (DAMPs) activate the NLRP3 inflamma-
some, but the mechanisms by which these structurally distinct
molecules trigger NLRP3 oligomerization and inflammasome acti-
vation are currently unclear and have been intensely debated in
the literature [46]. A model in which the generation of ROS is
one of the crucial elements for NLRP3 activation has been sug-
gested [47]. However, recent studies in mice and humans defective
in the generation of ROS failed to support this hypothesis and
strongly suggested anti-inflammatory effects of ROS [48,49]. Fur-
thermore, SOD was reported to be required for the activation of
caspase-1; SOD1 deficiency led to more ROS in macrophages but
caused caspase-1 inhibition by specific oxidation and glutathiony-
lation [50].

In this study, Chry did not generate more intracellular ROS than
LIB (Fig. 4), which was associated with more protein oxidation and
tyrosine nitration. In addition, Chry promoted production of
MnSOD protein but LIB did not. It seems unlikely that ROS were
driving activation of the inflammasome in Chry treated THP-1 cells.

However, an alternative model of inflammasome activation that
takes into account the size of the activators is the lysosome rupture
model, which is particularly useful in explaining NLRP3 inflamma-
some activation by large particulate activators, such as Chry.
According to this model, when phagocytosed particulates are too
large to be efficiently cleared, inefficient clearance of the activating
particle following phagocytosis leads to phagosomal destabiliza-
tion and lysosomal rupture [47]. Lysosomal damage results in the
release of lysosomal proteases into the cytosol that mediates
NLRP3 inflammasome activation [51,52]. Since the selected model
for inflammasome activation is closely related to the particulate
size, it is reasonable to link the consequences of THP-1 cells in re-
sponse to Chry and LIB with their remarkably different physical
sizes. Chrysotile fibers belong to the group of longer and thinner fi-
bers; the length of Chry is about 3 times that of LIB, and the mean
surface area is about 5–6 times that of LIB (see Table 1), suggesting
that Chry has more potential to result in aggressive lysosomal rup-
ture and subsequent activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. It has
been well-demonstrated that longer fibers are incapable of under-
going phagocytosis in vitro and in animals [21]. Long fibers have a
greater potency than short fibers in assays of pro-inflammatory
and genotoxic activity [53], and stimulate greater release of IL-1b
by macrophages [5]. Therefore, further study of the correlations
between particle size and activation of the inflammasome would
be particularly interesting. In contrast, LIB probably stimulates
more ROS production via a tightly controlled ROS-mediated model
[51] in which, ROS primes NLRP3 on the one hand, but may impact
inflammasome activation and down-regulate caspase-1 activity on
the other hand.

4.3. Signaling cascade in BEAS-2B cells mediated by the conditioned
medium

We have demonstrated that IL-1b is a major player in THP-1
conditioned medium, leading to the initiation of the inflammatory
response in the BEAS-2B cells. Besides IL-1b, we also detected lip-
ids peroxides in conditioned medium (Fig. 4D) which is possibly
another ‘‘alarm’’ signal that triggers responses in BEAS-2B. How-
ever, this should be specifically identified and confirmed in future
studies.

Combining our findings with those from others, the process
through which IL-1b triggers BEAS-2B release of IL-6 likely consists



Fig. 9. Proposed schema for Chry and LIB induced signal transduction from the macrophage to the epithelium. In the macrophage ‘‘priming’’ step, the pro-inflammatory
signals mediate activation of receptors and induction of NLRP3, procaspase-1 and pro-IL-1b. When macrophages are exposed to chrysotile fibers, phagocytosis is followed by
phagosomal destabilization and lysosomal rupture. Lysosomal damage results in the release of cathepsin B into the cytosol that triggers three members of NLRP3
inflammasome to assemble and subsequent activation of ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD). This second step eventually activates pro-caspase-
1, which in turn cleaves pro-IL-1b. In comparison to chrysotile, the relatively smaller size of the Libby amphibole probably results in more ROS production via a tightly
controlled ROS-mediated model in which, ROS activate NLRP3, although high oxygen tension can also impact inflammasome function and down-regulate caspase-1 activity.
In the epithelial cell, IL-1b signal transduction is initiated through a ligand-induced conformational change in the first extracellular domain of the IL-1RI that facilitates
recruitment of IL-1RacP. Meanwhile, IL-1Ra can block the IL-1b signaling. The trimetric complex rapidly assembles two intracellular signaling proteins, MYD88, and IRAK,
then through TRAF6 (TNF receptor-associated factor 6) linked to the downstream protein kinase cascades, including MAPK kinase family, Cot and IjB kinases (IKKs). The
activation of ERK1/2 or other MAPKs leads to activation of the AP-1 transcription factor; the IKKb-mediated phosphorylation of p65 modulates NF-jB activity. Both AP-1 and
NF-jB can directly up-regulate its target gene, IL-6. IL-6 further contributes to asbestos-related pathological phenotypes, such as asbestosis, lung cancer, and mesothelioma.

of the following steps, as illustrated in Fig. 9. The initial step in IL-
1b signal transduction is a ligand-induced conformational change
in the first extracellular domain of the IL-1RI that facilitates
recruitment of IL-1RacP. Through conserved cytosolic regions
called Toll- and IL-1R-like (TIR) domains, the trimetric complex
rapidly assembles two intracellular signaling proteins, myeloid dif-
ferentiation primary response gene 88 (MYD88) and interleukin-1
receptor–activated protein kinase (IRAK) [41]. The IL-1R�TLR
receptor-mediated signals, which are linked to the downstream
protein kinase cascades, have been studied extensively. Members
of the MAPK kinase (MAPKKK; called MAP3 K here) family, includ-
ing MEKK1, 2, 3 and Cot (Tpl2 or MAP3K8) are critical in this pro-
cess [54–56]. The activation of ERK1/2 or other MAPKs leads to
activation of the AP-1 transcription factor, which could directly
up-regulate its target gene, IL-6. In addition, the IKKb-mediated
phosphorylation of p65 at Ser536 requires the upstream kinases
Cot (Tpl2) and PKCf [57]. Then, in turn, IL-6 may act as a significant
autocrine growth factor in epithelial cells [58,59] to further induce
asbestos-related pathological phenotypes, such as asbestosis, lung
cancer, and mesothelioma.

5. Conclusion

We have investigated the signal transduction from the THP-1
macrophages to bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) in response
to Chry and LIB through direct treatments of THP-1 cells followed
by THP-1 conditioned medium treatments of BEAS-2B. We found
that direct treatments of THP-1 cells with Chry and LIB differen-
tially activated the inflammasome in processing IL-1b. IL-1b in con-
ditioned medium acts as a secondary mediator to trigger BEAS-2B
cells signaling cascades, including ERK, Cot, and then AP-1 and NF-
kB, to induce IL-6, which then leads epithelial cells to pathologic
phenotypes. Using IL-1Ra could interrupt the interaction and
may have a potential therapeutic effect when exposure to patho-
genic particles occurs.

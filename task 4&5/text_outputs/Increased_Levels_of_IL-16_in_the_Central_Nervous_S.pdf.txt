Simple Summary: Interleukin-16 is a protein involved in the migration of some immune cells and
plays an important role in the development of multiple sclerosis, an inflammatory demyelinating
disease that affects the central nervous system (i.e., brain and spinal cord). Currently, it is not fully
understood which cells produce interleukin-16 during the inflammatory response in the central
nervous system. This study investigates the correlation between the expression levels of interleukin-
16 and the severity of neuroinflammation and determines the cells which produce interleukin-16,
using a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. Our data show that the expression levels of interleukin-16
are significantly increased in the brain and spinal cord tissues of the mouse model compared to
controls. Furthermore, other immune assays reveal that the significantly increased number of cells
expressing interleukin-16 in the central nervous system lesions are likely to be infiltrating immune
cells and resident glial cells, but not neurons. Our findings suggest that interleukin-16 is closely
involved in the pathology of multiple sclerosis and other inflammatory diseases in the central nervous
system via the glial and infiltrating immune cells.

Abstract: Interleukin (IL)-16, a CD4+ immune cell specific chemoattractant cytokine, has been shown
to be involved in the development of multiple sclerosis, an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the
central nervous system (CNS). While immune cells such as T cells and macrophages are reported to
be the producers of IL-16, the cellular source of IL-16 in the CNS is less clear. This study investigates
the correlation of IL-16 expression levels in the CNS with the severity of neuroinflammation and
determines the phenotype of cells which produce IL-16 in the CNS of experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice. Our data show that IL-16 expression is significantly increased in the
brain and spinal cord tissues of EAE mice compared to phosphate buffered saline (PBS) immunised
controls. Dual immunofluorescence staining reveals that the significantly increased IL-16+ cells in
the CNS lesions of EAE mice are likely to be the CD45+ infiltrating immune cells such as CD4+ or
F4/80+ cells and the CNS resident CD11b+ microglia and GFAP+ astrocytes, but not NeuN+ neurons.
Our data suggest cytokine IL-16 is closely involved in EAE pathology as evidenced by its increased
expression in the glial and infiltrating immune cells, which impacts the recruitment and activation of
CD4+ immune cells in the neuroinflammation.

1. Introduction

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune, demyelinating disease which affects more
than 2.2 million people worldwide [1]. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)

is the most commonly used animal model for studying MS as many studies have suggested
its close immunopathological resemblance to that found in MS [2,3]. In MS/EAE, the
inflammatory response is primarily driven by myelin specific T cells and B cells infiltrating
the central nervous system (CNS) by crossing the blood brain barrier [4]. Following entry,
the lymphocytes are reactivated by antigen-presenting cells in the CNS to release pro-
inflammatory mediators, which induce activation of resident microglia and astrocytes as
well as other infiltrating immune cells. This cascade of inflammatory response often leads
to myelin and axonal damage [5–7].

Interleukin (IL)-16 is a cytokine that was initially identified as a lymphocyte chemoat-
tractant factor for T cells [8,9]. IL-16 is predominantly produced by CD4+ and CD8+

cells [10] as a precursor protein known as pro-IL-16, which is enzymatically cleaved by
caspase 3, releasing the bioactive mature form of IL-16 [11]. Other cells that can produce
IL-16 include monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), mast cells, fibroblasts and
microglia [12]. IL-16 is a ligand for the CD4 receptor, and cell surface expression of CD4
is required to exert the bioactivities of IL-16 observed in immune cells [12]. Through
interaction with CD4, IL-16 can act as a chemoattract to a variety of CD4+ immune cells.
IL-16 may also function as a ligand of CD9 as reported in human lung cancer cells [13].

IL-16 has been designated as a pro-inflammatory cytokine that activates immune
T cells [9] and macrophages [14]. Several studies have suggested that IL-16 is involved
in the development of various autoimmune diseases including MS [12,15,16]. IL-16 is
found to be secreted from MS patient-derived cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) when
stimulated with the myelin-specific antigen proteolipid protein, suggesting a role for IL-
16 in MS disease [17]. Furthermore, anti-IL-16 antibody treatment has been shown to
ameliorate relapses in EAE mice and diminish the CNS infiltration by CD4+ T cells [18].
However, conditioned media from lymphocyte preparations containing IL-16 are shown
to be neuroprotective against kainate-induced excitotoxicity and neuronal death [19]. In
addition, recombinant IL-16 reduces neuronal excitability and synaptic activity in mice
primary hippocampal cultures [20]. This study examines whether the expression of IL-16
is altered in the brain and spinal cord of EAE mice. We also determine whether IL-16
expression correlates with neuroinflammation and identify the cellular sources of IL-
16 within the CNS. Findings from this study suggest the close involvement of IL-16 in
EAE development, which is likely to contribute to CNS neuroinflammation via both the
infiltrating immune and the CNS resident cells.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Mice and EAE Induction

Naïve C57BL/6J mice were bred and maintained in the Biological Procedure Unit at
the University of Strathclyde. Female animals at eight weeks of age were used in all experi-
ments. All animal experiments were performed under the guidelines of the UK Animals
(Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and were conducted under a Project License granted by
the UK Home Office and with ethical approval from the University of Strathclyde Animal
Welfare Ethical Review Body.

EAE was induced as previously described [21]. Mice were immunized s.c. on day 0
with 100 µL of 100 µg MOG35-55 (ChinaPeptides Co Ltd., China) emulsified in complete
Freunds adjuvant (CFA; Merck, Germany) supplemented with 500 µg mycobacterium tuber-
culosis (BD Biosciences, UK). In addition, each mouse received 100 ng pertussis toxin (PTX;
Tocris Bioscience, UK) in 100 µL PBS injected i.p. on day 0 and again on day 2. PBS control
mice received 100 µL of PBS emulsified in the above CFA without MOG35-55, together with
the two doses of PTX injection. The number of animals used in each experiment varied
from 3 to 15 and is detailed in each figure legend. Mice were monitored daily for signs of
disease development, and clinical scores were recorded based on the following evaluation
system: 0 = no clinical sign; 0.5 = partial loss of tail tone; 1.0 = complete loss of tail tone;
1.5 = altered gait; 2.0 = hind limb weakness; 2.5 = paralysis of one leg; 3.0 = hind limb



Biology 2021, 10, 472 3 of 15

paralysis; 3.5 = hind limb paralysis with significantly reduced mobility; 4.0 = forelimb
involvement; 5.0 = moribund. There was no unexpected mortality in our studies.

2.2. Brain and Spinal Cord Tissue Preparation for Immunohistochemistry

PBS or MOG35-55 immunised mice were sacrificed via asphyxiation in a CO2 chamber
on day 12 (EAE onset), 16 (EAE peak) and 26 (EAE resolution) post immunisation. Animals
were first perfused with PBS, after which brains were harvested and spinal cords flushed
out with PBS by hydrostatic pressure using a sterile 19G needle. After collection, tissues
were placed in Optimal Cutting Temperature compound (OCT) mounting medium and
frozen on dry ice before being cut into 7-µM-thick sections on a Shandon cryotome (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, UK).

2.3. Immunohistochemistry

Frozen tissue sections were stained with antibodies against CD4 (eBioscience, UK, #
14-0042-85), CD45 (eBioscience, UK, # 14-0451-85) and IL-16 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK,
# PA5-20670, detecting both pro-IL-16 and bioactive IL-16) followed by incubation with an
appropriate biotin-conjugated secondary antibody (eBioscience, UK), horseradish peroxidase
and ImmPACT AMEC red peroxidase substrate (Vector Laboratories, USA) for detection.
Finally, sections were counterstained in Gill 2 haematoxylin (Merck, Germany). The stained
slides were viewed using a Nikon Eclipse 50 bright field microscope. Images of three different
magnifications (×10, ×20, and ×40) were taken using a digital camera (Nikon Digital Sight
DS-U3) connected to a computer containing NIS Element F 3.2 imaging software.

For immunofluorescence staining, frozen tissue sections were stained with antibodies
against CD4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, # 14-0451-85), CD11b (Thermo Fisher Scientific, # 14-
0112-85), CD45 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, # 14-0451-85), F4/80 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, # 14-
4801-85), GFAP (Cell Signalling Technology, UK, # 36708), NeuN (Merck Millipore, Germany, #
MAB377) and IL-16 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, # PA5-20670). This was followed by incubation
with appropriate Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Finally, sections were mounted with vectashield containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Slides
were then visualized on a Nikon Eclipse E600 epiflorescent microscope.

2.4. Quantification of Positive Staining Cells in the CNS

All quantification of positive staining was carried out using ImageJ. Regions of interest
(ROIs) were determined by using fixed size and location were evenly distributed across
the relevant areas depending on the tissue and particular area being analysed. For the
spinal cord, ten ROIs were assigned across the white and grey matter of each spinal cord.
For cerebellum analysis, three ROIs were used in each of the cerebellar white matter,
granular layer and molecular layer per mouse. Finally, three ROIs were used for each of
hippocampal C1, C2 and C3 regions and two areas of dentate gyrus for each mouse. ROIs
were comparable between individual mice.

The total number of cells and the number of either single or double positive cells
within each ROI were counted and recorded. The percentage of positive cells within each
tissue section was presented in the figures, with n representing the number of animals.

2.5. Tissue Preparation for ELISA

Spleens were harvested from EAE mice and PBS controls on day 16 and disrupted to
form a single cell suspension. Splenocytes were cultured in 24-well plates at 2 × 106 cells/well
with media alone, media with 50 µg/mL MOG35-55 or media with 50 µg/mL Concanavalin A
(ConA) (SigmaAldrich, UK) and incubated at 37 ◦C in a cell incubator with 5% CO2. After
72 h, cell supernatants were collected.

Spinal cords and brain (divided into cerebellum and cerebrum) tissues were collected
from EAE mice and PBS control mice on day 16 and then homogenised in PBS containing
10 µL/mL Halt™ Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min. Supernatants were then collected.



Biology 2021, 10, 472 4 of 15

The levels of IL-16 in the supernatants collected from cell culture and CNS tissues
were detected by ELISA following the manufacturers’ guidelines (R&D Systems, Mouse
IL-16 Duoset ELISA, # DY1727, calibrated against a sequence of bioactive IL-16, which is
also part of the pro-IL-16.)

2.6. Statistics

All statistics were carried out using Graph Pad Prism software. All data are expressed
as mean ± S.E.M. in all experiments. EAE clinical data were analysed using two-way
repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc test where required. Statistical
analysis of all other data was performed using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc
where required, with p < 0.05 being taken as indicative of statistical significance.

3. Results
3.1. The Levels of IL-16 in CNS Tissues of EAE Mice Are Elevated and Correlate with the Severity
of CNS Inflammation

Mice immunised with PBS emulsified in CFA together with the injection of PTX
did not develop EAE clinical signs while mice immunized with MOG35-55 developed a
monophasic disease course with EAE onset occurring around day 12 (onset stage) with a
disease incidence rate of 100% by day 15 post immunisation (Figure 1A). Disease severity
reached its peak on day 16 (peak stage), after which the mice began to gradually recover,
with a steady decrease in the clinical score (day 26, resolution stage). Histological analysis
with anti-CD45 staining confirmed the extent of inflammation and the levels of cellular
infiltration in the spinal cord (Figure 1B), brain hippocampus and cerebellum tissues
(Figure 1C,D) over the course of EAE, particularly at the peak stage, while very few CD45+

cells or inflammation were observed in the CNS of control group mice.
Immune cells of EAE mice produce increased antigen-specific cytokines following

in vitro stimulation [22], and we also observed antigen-specific increases in IFN-γ, IL-17 and
IL-6 production following MOG35-55 peptide stimulation by EAE splenocytes compared to
PBS and naive controls (data not shown). However, we sought to focus on investigating
the production of IL-16 using an ELISA kit from R&D Systems detecting both pro-IL-16
and bioactive IL-16. Spleen cells from both PBS and EAE mice groups on day 16 post
immunisation demonstrated consistently high levels of IL-16 production with no statistical
difference between the EAE and PBS control groups with or without MOG35-55 in the
culture (Figure 1E). Cells stimulated with ConA in the culture induced similar levels of
IL-16 production when compared with cells treated with MOG35-55 or medium alone. The
data suggest that IL-16 is constitutively released by splenocytes in PBS or MOG peptide
immunised mice.

We then examined the levels of IL-16 in spinal cord, cerebellum and cerebrum of EAE
on day 12, day 16 and day 26 of disease onset, peak and resolution stages respectively, to-
gether with tissues of PBS-immunised control mice harvested on day 16 post-immunisation
(equivalent to the EAE peak stage). All tissues were homogenised to determine the lev-
els of both pro-IL-16 and bioactive IL-16 by ELISA (Figure 1F). Spinal cord tissues of
MOG35-55-immunised mice showed significantly elevated levels of IL-16 on day 12 and
day 16 compared to day 16 PBS control mice. IL-16 levels were then substantially reduced
on day 26 relative to day 12 and day 16. While IL-16 was detected in brain cerebellum and
cerebrum tissues of PBS mice, the levels were significantly higher in these tissues of EAE
day 12 and day 16 mice, decreasing towards control levels on day 26.

3.2. IL-16 and Its Receptor CD4 Expressing Cells Are Predominantly Located in the CNS Lesions

Having shown significantly increased levels of IL-16 protein in the CNS tissues of
EAE mice, we next investigated the location of IL-16 within the CNS in EAE and control
mice, using immunohistochemical staining with an antibody which detects all forms of
IL-16. In the spinal cord, the percentage of IL-16+ cells was comparable in the grey matter
(GM) region between PBS and different stages of EAE mice (Figure 2A,B). However, there
was a significant increase in the percentage of IL-16+ cells within the white matter (WM)
and the lesion regions for EAE day 12 and day 16 mice compared to PBS controls as well
as EAE day 26 mice, with both of these groups demonstrating few IL-16 expressing cells
(Figure 2A,B).

IL-16 expression was also examined in sagittal brain sections, specifically the hip-
pocampus and the cerebellum regions where the immune cell infiltration was particularly
evident. In the hippocampus (Figure 2C,D), IL-16 was found to be highly expressed in the
CA1-CA3 and dentate gyrus regions in all groups of mice. The percentage of IL-16+ cells
within the hippocampus of EAE mice was significantly increased in clusters of infiltrating
cells within lesions for day 12 and day 16 EAE mice (Figure 2C). In the dentate gyrus,
cellular infiltration and lesions were observed with significantly increased percentage of
IL-16+ cells in EAE day 12 and day 16 mice compared to PBS controls (Figure 2D), although
in the day 26 EAE resolution stage, the percentage of IL-16+ cells was similar to control
values. The IL-16 expression level in the hippocampus and dentate gyrus without lesions
was comparable between all EAE groups and PBS controls.

In the cerebellum (Figure 2E,F), IL-16 was constitutively expressed in both control
and EAE groups, with the percentage of IL-16+ cells significantly increased in tissues
of day 12 and day 16 EAE mice in comparison to PBS control mice, with no difference
observed between day 26 EAE and control mice. Analysis of IL-16+ cells in the WM
(Figure 2E) and molecular layer (ML, Figure 2F) of the cerebellum revealed significant
increases in the percentage of IL-16+ cells in EAE groups (days 12 and 16) compared to PBS
controls, whereas EAE day 26 levels were not significantly changed relative to PBS mice.
Furthermore, the significant increase correlated with the lesions in the WM and ML, as the
IL-16 expression level in the cerebellum without lesions was comparable between all EAE
groups and PBS controls.

We next studied the expression of IL-16 receptor CD4 in CNS tissues of control and EAE
mice. CD4+ cells were detected in EAE spinal cord tissue during all three time points but
were absent in PBS controls (Figure 3A). However, a significantly higher percentage of CD4+

cells was observed within close proximity of the inflammatory WM lesions of EAE groups
(day 12 and day 16) in comparison to the day 26 resolution stage of EAE mice with only small
clusters of few cells shown within the WM of the spinal cord. Similar findings were observed
in the hippocampus (Figure 3B) and cerebellum (Figure 3C) regions of EAE mice, with the
majority of the CD4+ cells observed within close proximity of inflammatory lesions.

3.3. Increased IL-16 Expression Co-Localises with Infiltrating Immune Cells 
Having established increased IL-16 expression in the CNS of EAE mice, we next 

sought to identify the cells that are associated with this increase. Our data show there was 
little colocalisation of IL-16 with CD45, CD4, F4/80 positive cells in the CNS of control 
mice. However, IL-16 was expressed by a significant percentage of CD45+ cells within the 
lesions predominantly in the WM of spinal cord tissues in all EAE group mice (Figure 4A). 
The percentage of IL-16+ CD45+ co-expressing cells was significantly higher in EAE day 12 
and EAE day 16 groups, and in the EAE day 26 group, the percentage was reduced 
compared with day 12 and day 16. Further study using antibodies of CD4 and F4/80 
suggests that these increased CD45+IL-16+ cells include those of CD4+ (Figure 4B) and 
F4/80+ (Figure 4C) infiltrating immune cells. 

In the brain, IL-16 colocalised with CD45+ cells predominantly within lesions was 
observed in the dentate gyrus and throughout the cerebellar WM region of EAE mice 
(Figure 4D–I). Within hippocampal lesions (Figure 4F), IL-16+ CD45+ co-expressing cells 
was significantly elevated in EAE day 12 and day 16 tissues compared to the PBS control

with day 12 and day 16. Further study using antibodies of CD4 and F4/80 suggests that
these increased CD45+IL-16+ cells include those of CD4+ (Figure 4B) and F4/80+ (Figure 4C)
infiltrating immune cells.

mice, which had few CD45+ IL-16+ cells. The percentage of IL-16+ CD45+ co-expressing cells 
was significantly reduced in tissues of day 26 EAE mice in comparison to that of day 12 
and day 16 EAE mice, but was still significantly higher than the PBS control. Similar 
results were also observed in the cerebellum (Figure 4H). 

Our data also show colocalisation of IL-16 with CD4+ cells predominantly within 
hippocampal (Figure 4G) and cerebellar (Figure 4I) lesion areas in EAE mice. Comparable 
levels of IL-16 expressing CD4+ cells were observed in EAE day 12 and day 16 mice, both 
significantly higher than that of the PBS control and day 26 EAE brain tissue. In contrast 
to EAE spinal cord sections, very few F4/80+ cells were detected in the brain tissues of EAE 
mice at all three time points; thus, no co-expression with IL-16 could be assessed.

Figure 4. Expression of IL-16 by infiltrating immune cells in EAE mice. Spinal cord and brains were harvested from EAE
and PBS control mice. Tissue was co-stained with IL-16 (green) and CD45, CD4, or F4/80 (all red). Representative images
of spinal cord (A–C), cerebellum (D) and hippocampus (E) tissues are shown. Dotted white lines indicate spinal cord
section edges. White arrows indicate areas of colocalization. Percentage of double-positive cells in each group within the
spinal cord (A–C), hippocampus (F,G) and cerebellum (H,I) were quantified with results expressed as the mean ± SEM.
N = 5. Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc tests. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01,

In the brain, IL-16 colocalised with CD45+ cells predominantly within lesions was
observed in the dentate gyrus and throughout the cerebellar WM region of EAE mice
(Figure 4D–I). Within hippocampal lesions (Figure 4F), IL-16+ CD45+ co-expressing cells
was significantly elevated in EAE day 12 and day 16 tissues compared to the PBS control
mice, which had few CD45+ IL-16+ cells. The percentage of IL-16+ CD45+ co-expressing
cells was significantly reduced in tissues of day 26 EAE mice in comparison to that of day

12 and day 16 EAE mice, but was still significantly higher than the PBS control. Similar
results were also observed in the cerebellum (Figure 4H).

Our data also show colocalisation of IL-16 with CD4+ cells predominantly within
hippocampal (Figure 4G) and cerebellar (Figure 4I) lesion areas in EAE mice. Comparable
levels of IL-16 expressing CD4+ cells were observed in EAE day 12 and day 16 mice, both
significantly higher than that of the PBS control and day 26 EAE brain tissue. In contrast to
EAE spinal cord sections, very few F4/80+ cells were detected in the brain tissues of EAE
mice at all three time points; thus, no co-expression with IL-16 could be assessed.

3.4. Increased IL-16 Co-Localises with Glial Cells but Not Neurons

Although IL-16 was clearly expressed by infiltrating immune cells within the CNS
tissues of EAE mice, constitutive expression of IL-16 in the spinal cord and brain tissues
across all groups suggests it is also expressed by CNS resident cells. Thus, next we studied
the co-localization of IL-16 with neurons and glia in the CNS under normal and diseased
conditions. Our data show that IL-16 co-localised with NeuN+ cells within the GM of spinal
cord of all mice examined (Figure 5A), with the percentage of NeuN+ cells expressing IL-16
being comparable between all three different stages of EAE mice and the control group.
However, compared to controls, the percentage of IL-16 expressing GFAP+ (Figure 5B) or
CD11b+ (Figure 5C) cells was significantly increased in the spinal cords of day 12 and day
16 EAE mice, predominantly within the WM lesions, whereas on day 26, colocalisation had
reduced to levels similar to those of control mice with few cells co-expressing both IL-16
and GFAP or IL-16 and CD11b.

The expression of IL-16 by CNS resident cells in the hippocampus and cerebellum
mirrored that observed in the spinal cord, with both hippocampal and cerebellar sections
containing a high percentage of NeuN+ neurons expressing IL-16 (Figure 5D,E,H). Compa-
rable levels were observed between all groups—PBS control and various disease stages
of EAE mice in both hippocampus and cerebellum regions. However the percentage of
IL-16 expressing GFAP+ (Figure 5D,F,I) or CD11b+ (Figure 5D,G,J) cells was significantly
increased in tissues of EAE mice at all three time points, with the highest percentage
observed on day 16, and slightly reduced levels on day 12 and on day 26 in tissues of
both the hippocampus and cerebellum. Few GFAP+ IL-16+ and CD11b+IL-16+ cells were
observed in the tissues of PBS control mice.

4. Discussion

EAE is the most commonly used animal model for studying MS because of its close
immunopathological resemblance to MS [2,23]. Here, we investigated the involvement of
IL-16 in the development of neuroinflammation by studying the expression and cellular
source of IL-16 within the CNS of MOG35-55 induced EAE mice.

While the roles of many immune cytokines such as IFN-γ, IL-17 and IL-10 in the
pathogenesis of MS/EAE are well documented [22,24], information is less clear for IL-
16. Several studies suggest a possible role of IL-16 in MS/EAE development [16,25], so
understanding of its function may provide new insights into the immunopathogenesis of
MS. IL-16 is produced by many cells including monocytes, mast cells and fibroblasts and is
a cytokine constitutive to T lymphocytes [12,25]. IL-16 has pleiotropic roles in the biological
functions of CD4+ T cells and therefore likely plays an important role in immune-mediated
diseases [8,12]. Studies using western blot show that pro-IL-16 and bioactive IL-16 are
expressed in the spleen and lymph node tissues of both relapsing and chronic EAE mice,
surprisingly with little difference in the expression levels between them [16], indicating the
expression levels of IL-16 in the lymphoid organs are likely not affected by the activation
status of the immune cells. The findings are supported by our ELISA data of the similar
levels of overall IL-16 production by the splenocytes of PBS and MOG35-55 immunised
mice and between cultures treated with medium, MOG35-55 antigen or ConA. However, T
cells isolated from the spleen and inguinal lymph nodes of naive and MOG35-55 immunised
mice have been shown to produce elevated levels of IL-16 upon in-vitro re-stimulation
with PHA (naïve mice cells) and MOG35-55 antigen or PHA (EAE mice cells) in comparison
to naïve control T cells [16]. These data suggest while activated T cells express higher levels
of IL-16 in response to antigen specific or non-specific stimulation, the change may not
be sufficient to influence the overall level of IL-16 expressed/produced by the lymphoid
organs which include different types of cells, many of which are important sources of IL-16
production [26,27]. The findings may also suggest a functional difference between IL-16
and the other well-studied immune cytokines such as IFN-γ and IL-17 [22] during the
development of inflammatory diseases such as MS/EAE.

Skundric et al. [16] reported in 2005 that a significant upregulation of bioactive IL-
16 was observed in the spinal cord tissues of acute, relapsing and chronic EAE mice in
comparison to controls using western blot analysis, with the highest observed in the
relapsing mice. Their findings were confirmed in MS patients using the same method,
with increased levels of both pro-IL-16 and bioactive IL-16 observed in the CNS lesions of
patients compared to controls, with the levels peaked in acute and diminished in subacute
lesions [12,25]. Our findings from examining the protein levels of IL-16 in the supernatants
of the spinal cord and brain cerebellum and cerebrum homogenates using ELISA agree
with these reports that the levels of IL-16 protein in the CNS were significantly increased
in the EAE mice at onset and peak stages in comparison to PBS immunised control mice,
with the highest levels in the tissues of EAE peak mice. These findings suggest a close
correlation of IL-16 expression levels in the CNS with the activity of neuroinflammation.

The upregulation of IL-16 in the CNS tissues of EAE mice was further confirmed by
immunohistochemical staining which revealed a significantly higher percentage of IL-16+

cells within the spinal cord of EAE mice particularly at the disease initiation and peak
time points, in comparison to PBS controls. Further analysis suggests that the increased
percentage of IL-16+ cells was primarily found within the inflammatory lesion in com-
parison to the equivalent area in the spinal cord, indicating a direct link between IL-16+

cells and neuroinflammation. Indeed, very few cells were IL-16+ in the tissues of PBS
controls and EAE resolution stage mice that had no or few lesions. Consistent findings of
increased percentages of IL-16+ cells within the inflammatory lesions were also observed
within the cerebellum and the hippocampus, the brain regions closely associated with MS
disease [28–30], of MOG35-55 immunised EAE mice.

The predominant expression of IL-16 in the lesions of CNS WM regions of EAE mice
suggests that IL-16 is likely to be expressed by the infiltrating immune cells within these



Biology 2021, 10, 472 13 of 15

areas; this was confirmed by the significantly increased percentage of CD45+ cells co-
expressing IL-16. Furthermore, the immunohistochemical staining data suggest that IL-16
is likely expressed by various immune cells including CD4+ cells and F4/80+ macrophages,
as well as CD11b+ monocytes/microglia cells, and GFAP+ astrocytes in the CNS. The
colocalisation of IL-16 and CD4 in the brain and spinal cord tissues of EAE mice is not
surprising as IL-16 was co-immunoprecipitated with CD4 in the CNS of EAE mice pre-
viously [16] and is a CD4+ T cell-specific chemokine attractant cytokine [18,31]. While
the IL-16 antibody we used was not able to distinguish between pro-IL-16 and bioactive
IL-16, Skundric et al. suggested that bioactive IL-16 was produced locally in the CNS by
infiltrating CD4+ T cells, as they reported the colocalisation of IL-16 with active caspase-3
in the mononuclear cells of EAE spinal cord [16]. This could explain the correlation of
IL-16 expression levels in the CNS with the severity of neuroinflammation indicated by the
number of infiltrating CD4+ cells shown in this study and previously [21]. However, the
upregulation of IL-16 was not limited to CD4+ cells in the CNS lesion of EAE mice; IL-16 is
reported to be expressed by B220+ B cells, CD8+ T cells and granulocytes [18,32]. Our study
also reveals other cellular sources of IL-16 from monocyte/macrophages, as upregulated
expression of IL-16 was observed in the infiltrating monocytes and CNS resident microglia
and astrocytes during the neuroinflammation of EAE mice. Our findings agree with previ-
ous reports indicating the expression of IL-16 by activated CD68+ microglia/macrophages
in the brain of focal cerebral infarction patients [32] or by the in vitro cultured microglia and
macrophage cells [33]. The data may suggest a key role IL-16 plays during the development
of neuroinflammation through the recruitment and activation of CD4+ T cells possibly via
both autocrine and paracrine manners.

The presence of IL-16 in the CNS tissues of PBS control mice while its receptor CD4
was absent indicates an alternate function of this cytokine in the CNS under a normal
physiological state. IL-16 is shown to be expressed in the CA1, CA2 and CA3 regions
of hippocampus, as well as the dentate gyrus. Within the cerebellum region, IL-16 was
dispersed throughout the molecular layer and in the granule cells within the granular layer.
Indeed, the expression of IL-16 is confirmed to be with NeuN+ neurons in both the spinal
cord and the brain. However, the expression level and pattern of IL-16 in neurons remain
the same throughout the EAE course. Thus, alterations in IL-16 expression in the CNS
during EAE are likely to originate from the infiltrating immune cells and the activated glial
cells, as the upregulation was predominantly found in the WM of the CNS tissues where
the cellular infiltration and the lesions were observed. The exact effect of IL-16 on neurons
is not known; we previously reported that IL-16 reduces hippocampal neuronal excitatory
and synaptic activity via CD4- and CD9-independent inhibition of sodium channel function
and GluA1 phosphorylation [20]. Therefore, further study is important to look at the CNS-
specific function of IL-16 under normal and neuroinflammatory conditions, which will also
provide new insights into the role of IL-16 in MS disease.

In conclusion, this study demonstrates a close correlation between the elevated expres-
sion of IL-16 in the CNS by the infiltrating immune cells such as CD4+ cells, macrophages
and the CNS resident microglia and astrocytes, with increased neuroinflammation in EAE.
Our findings suggest that the IL-16/CD4 signalling pathway is closely involved in the
neuroinflammation of MS and other neurological disorders through the immune and CNS
resident cells.

The regulator of cytokine signaling known as protein inhibitor of activated STAT-1 (PIAS1) is increasingly
understood to have diverse regulatory functions for inflammation, but its effect in inflammatory condi-
tions such as severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) has not previously been reported. The aim of this study was
to investigate the effect of upregulation of PIAS1 on SAP associated with acute lung injury (ALI), and its
subsequent effect on disease severity. Sprague–Dawley rats were given an IV injection of adenovirus
serotype 5 (Ad5)/F35-PIAS1, Ad5/F35-vector or saline before induction of SAP. The control group received
only a sham operation. Lung and pancreas samples were harvested 16 h after induction. The protein lev-
els of PIAS1 in tissue were investigated. The severity of pancreatic injury was determined by a histological
score of pancreatic injury, serum amylase, and pancreatic water content. The lung injury was evaluated
by measurement of pulmonary microvascular permeability, lung myeloperoxidase activity and malondi-
aldehyde levels. The survival rates of rats were also analyzed. The results found that in Ad5/F35-PIAS1
treated rats, serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, interleukin (IL)-1b and IL-6 levels were decreased
but showed no influence on the levels of IL-10, and the severity of pancreatic tissue injury was less
compared with either untreated SAP or Ad5/F35-vector treated rats (P < 0.01). The administration of
Ad5/F35-PIAS1 in SAP-induced rats downregulated the activity of the signal transducer and activator
of transcription-1 (STAT1) pathway and the expressions of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and
intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 protein in lung. Thus, compared with the untreated SAP rats,
the inflammatory response and the severity of ALI decreased, and the survival rates increased
(P < 0.01). These findings suggest that PIAS1 could augment anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting
STAT1, thus attenuating the severity of SAP associated with ALI.

1. Introduction

Acute pancreatitis is the sudden onset of inflammation of the
pancreas, affecting �30–40 individuals per 100,000. It carries an
overall mortality rate of 10–15% [1], but the rate approaches 30–
40% for especially severe cases [2]. Deaths associated with severe
acute pancreatitis (SAP) are mainly due to its major complication,
the development of multiple organ dysfunction syndromes (for-
merly known as multiple organ failure). Acute lung injury (ALI) is
a major component of this complication, clinically manifested as
acute respiratory distress syndrome [3]. Despite significant ad-
vances in understanding the pathogenesis of ALI in SAP and its
management, the mortality rate remains unacceptably high.

Studies have shown that pancreatic damage due to SAP leads to
the release of systemic inflammatory cytokines, including tumor

necrosis factor (TNF)-a and interleukin (IL)-1b. These cytokines
may result in distant organ damage and the development of ALI.
They therefore play a key role in the pathogenesis of SAP with
ALI, and are ultimately responsible for the majority of deaths asso-
ciated with this condition [4]. Related studies found that the tran-
scriptional induction of genes involved in the release of
inflammatory cytokines associated with SAP is controlled by vari-
ous regulated factors, including the Janus kinase/signal transducer
and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway [5].

A family of negative regulators of the JAK/STAT signaling path-
way is that of the protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS), with
four members: PIAS1, PIAS3, PIASx, and PIASy. Gene activation
analyzes show that PIAS1 selectively regulates a subset of STAT1-
dependent genes, with a notable preference for inflammatory
response [6]. Related studies found that PIAS1-null mice demon-
strated a hypersensitivity to lipopolysaccharide-induced septic
shock, and others indicate that PIAS1 is involved into in response
to inflammatory stimuli, such as TNF-a and lipopolysaccharide [7].

PIAS1 participates in anti-inflammatory responses by regulating
the transcription factor, nuclear factor-j-light-chain-enhancer of

activated B cells. This transcription factor is involved in the induc-
tion of approximately 200 genes, many of which are involved in
inflammatory responses [8–10]. In addition, PIAS1 has also been
suggested to promote the sumoylation of the transcription factor
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-c, resulting in the
trans-repression of inflammatory gene activation [11]. These find-
ings support a hypothesis that a focus on the regulation of PIAS1
might be a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of inflam-
matory disorders. However, past studies have not fully addressed
whether the administration of PIAS1 would prove equally effica-
cious if administered upon the onset of SAP. As well, the precise
mechanisms determining the effect of PIAS1 on SAP relative to
the degree of lung injury are largely unknown.

The purpose of this study was to elucidate the up-regulating ef-
fect of PIAS1 on SAP associated with ALI. We performed a series of
studies to explore for a new therapeutic agent for SAP, including
total water content, scoring of lung injury, neutrophil count in
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), lung tissue myeloperoxidase
(MPO) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and inflammatory
mediators levels, and a survival analysis of rats with SAP.
2. Materials and methods

2.1. Animals and reagents

The male Sprague–Dawley rats, 150–200 g, obtained from the
animal experimental department of Ruijin Hospital were randomly
divided into the following groups.

In the SAP group (n = 20), 24 h prior to the start of the experi-
ments the rats were deprived of food but allowed access to water.
The rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pento-
barbital (30%, 0.15 mL/100 g). SAP was induced by retrograde infu-
sion of 3.5% sodium taurocholate (1.5 mL/kg, Sigma–Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA) into the pancreatic duct transduodenally for
2–3 min via a 24-gauge angiocath using a constant infusion rate
of 100 lL/min under laparotomy. The abdominal wounds were
closed and the rats returned to their cages with free access to water
and food after surgery.

In treated groups, we used replication-defective adenovirus sero-
type 5/F35 (Ad5/F35) as the vector. Ad5/F35-PIAS1 was constructed
by Benyuanzhengyang Bio. (Shanghai, China) using the previously
described method [12]. PIAS1 cDNA, containing the full-length
translated regions, were sub-cloned into the PDC316-MCMV-EGFP
transfer plasmid. This plasmid was cotransfected into 293 cells,
along with a fragment of the plasmid containing the Ad5/F35 aden-
oviral vector. Additionally, an Ad5/F35 containing an empty expres-
sion cassette was constructed for use as a control (Ad5/F35-vector).
All of the viral constructs were similar with the exception of the
transgene, and the production and purification procedures were
identical. The dosage of Ad5/F35 delivery to these animals was based
on our previous studies’ results (Un-published data). Ad5/F35-PIAS1
or Ad5/F35-vector (3.6 � 108 PFU/100 g in 25 lL sterile PBS) was
delivered by IV injection through the penile vein in rats at 10 min,
on day 1, or on day 2 prior to SAP induction (n = 10, 10 and 10, respec-
tively for each treatment). For these treatment groups, SAP was in-
duced with 3.5% sodium taurocholate as described above. Based on
the results of PIAS1 protein expression levels, on day 2 before SAP
induction, rats who had received the Ad5/F35-PIAS1 or Ad5/F35-
vector treatment were selected for future study.

In the control group (n = 10), rats were given only a sham oper-
ation, consisting of administration of an equal volume of PBS (with
no SAP induction, Ad5/F35-PIAS1 or Ad5/F35-vector treatment).

Blood samples, pancreatic and lung tissues were harvested at
16 h after the onset of induction according to our previous
methods [13]. The serum was separated from blood by a 1600g,
10 min centrifugation for examination. The experiments were
conducted according to the Guidelines of the Shanghai Animal
Use and Care Committee and the National Animal Welfare Law.

2.2. Morphological examination

Pancreatic and lung tissue samples were fixed in 4% formalde-
hyde overnight and subsequently dehydrated through a graded
ethanol series. After impregnation in paraffin wax, tissue samples
were cut into blocks (4 lm). Pancreatic and lung tissues were
stained with hematoxylin–eosin (H&E) and examined by light
microscopy. Sections were examined by an experienced morphol-
ogist, who was blinded to the sample identity, for tissue injury.
For this study, five randomly chosen microscopic fields were exam-
ined for each tissue sample and given a histological score for injury
according to the previously described method [14,15].

2.3. Wet/dry weight ratio of pancreatic or lung tissue

Pancreatic or lung tissue edema was evaluated by tissue water
content. A portion of the pancreatic or lung tissue was taken imme-
diately after sacrifice, to trim fat and weigh. Tissue water content
was determined by calculating the wet weight/dry weight ratio
according to the formula: [(wet weight � dry weight)/dry
weight] � 100%, where the wet weight was the initial weight of
the respective tissue and the weight after incubation at 72 �C for
24 h was the dry weight.

2.4. Biochemical assays

Serum amylase level was determined by a Beckman CX7 Chem-
istry Analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA). Serum TNF-a,
IL-1b, IL-6 and IL-10 levels were evaluated by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA kit, Mai Bio, Shanghai, China).

2.5. Lung tissue MPO and MDA assays

To carry out the assays, 1 g lung tissue samples were thawed,
homogenized in 1 M PBS (pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 12,000g for
10 min at 4 �C. The supernatant was assayed for MPO activity
and MDA concentration with test kits (Jianchen Bio, Nanjing,
China). All procedures were done in accordance with the manufac-
turer’s instructions.

2.6. Neutrophil counting in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF)

Rats were anesthetized with intraperitoneal pentobarbital, and a
median sternotomy allowed for exposure of both lungs. The trachea
was exposed and inserted with an IV infusion needle. After ligating
the hilum of the right lung, the left lung was lavaged five times with
1 mL ice-cold PBS. The recovery ratio of the fluid was about 90%. The
BALF was then centrifuged at 1000g for 10 min to separate cells
from the supernatant. Cells were suspended in saline and the num-
ber of neutrophils was counted with a hemocytometer.

2.7. Western blot assay

Tissue samples were washed twice with PBS, homogenized with
a tissue homogenizer in RIPA buffer (Biyuntian Shanghai, China),
and centrifuged at 12,000g at 4 �C for 10 min. The supernatants
were collected and stored at �80 �C. Protein concentration of each
sample was determined by bicinchoninic acid protein assay
(Biyuntian, Shanghai, China). Each sample was adjusted up to the
desired protein content of 40 lg, denatured in loading buffer
(62 mM Tris, 10% glycerol, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS),
0.003% bromophenol blue) and separated by electrophoresis on a



P. Chen et al. / Cytokine 54 (2011) 305–314 307
6% SDS–polyacrylamide gel at 100 V for 120 min. The separated
proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane
by using transfer buffer (39 mM glycine, 48 mM Tris pH 8.3, 20%
methanol) at 200 mA for 90 min. The membranes were blocked
with 5% non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS)-0.1% Tween
for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times for 10 min in TBS-
0.1% Tween. They were then incubated with a primary antibody,
either STAT1, phosphorylated STAT1 (P-STAT1; Cell Signaling
Biotechnology, Danvers, MA, USA, diluted to 1:1000), PIAS1, intra-
cellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, or matrix metalloproteinase-
9 (MMP-9; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA, di-
luted to 1:500), each in TBS-0.1% Tween, overnight at 4 �C. After
being washed 3 � for 10 min in TBS-0.1% Tween, the membranes
were incubated with a second antibody: peroxidase-conjugated
goat anti-rabbit IgG, rabbit anti-goat IgG or rabbit anti-mouse

IgG (Kangcheng, Shanghai, China) for 1 h at room temperature.
After washing, the membranes were detected by enhanced chemi-
luminescence methods (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ, USA). The
PIAS1, STAT1, P-STAT1, ICAM-1 and MMP-9 proteins were quanti-
fied by scanning densitometry using a bio-image analysis system
(Bio-Rad, Baltimore, MD, USA). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehy-
drogenase (GAPDH) protein was determined in a similar manner
with anti-GAPDH antibody (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA, diluted to
1:500) as an endogenous control for other proteins.

2.8. Immunohistochemical localization of PIAS1

A volume of 4 lm paraffin embedded pancreatic or lung tissue
sections was deparaffinized, mounted on poly-L-lysine-coated glass
slides, and incubated with PIAS1 antibody (1:50 dilution). Protein
with PIAS1 and GAPDH antibodies (A). Treatments administered at different time
ntrol rats. Immunohistochemical localization of PIAS1 expression was observed in
ts on day 2 before SAP induction, SAP and control rats: lung and pancreatic cells
staining was found in control rats; PIAS1 protein expression was not remarkable in

antigen expression was detected using biotin-conjugated goat anti-
rabbit IgG (Maixin Biotech, Fuzhou, China) and was visualized by a
10 min application of 3,3-diaminobenzidine. The sections were
counterstained with hematoxylin to identify nuclei and observed
under a light microscope. Random observation of five high micro-
scope views was used to evaluate staining results. Brown staining
cells were defined as positive protein expression cells.

2.9. Survival studies

Additional groups of 10 rats each were treated as described
above, and were included in survival studies. The rats were al-
lowed free access to food and water, and the survival time was re-
corded for 48 h.

2.10. Statistical analysis

All data were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD).
Statistics were done using Statistical Package for the Social Sci-
ences (SPSS) software, version 10.5. The one-way analysis of vari-
ance (ANOVA) with Dunnett’s multiple comparison tests was
used for comparisons. The survival curve was estimated using
the Kaplan–Meier method. The log-rank test was used to compare
survival time in each group. The life table method was used to
evaluate the survival rate. A P-value <0.05 was considered statisti-
cally significant.

3. Results

3.1. Expression of PIAS1 protein

On the Western blot, PIAS1 protein was very weakly distin-
guishable in lung and pancreas between the untreated SAP and
Ad5/F35-vector treated rats. However, treatment with Ad5/F35-
PIAS1 resulted in a much greater increase in the PIAS1 protein
expression level in lung and pancreas, and more so when the treat-
ment was administered on day 2 than at either 10 min or 1 day be-
fore SAP induction (Fig. 1A). The expressions of PIAS1 were also

investigated by immunohistochemical staining in lung and pancre-
atic tissue of all rats. The results showed that in the Ad5/F35-PIAS1
treated rats, there was remarkable positive staining for PIAS1 in
endothelial cells of lung and pancreatic acinar cells. However,
PIAS1 was weakly expressed in control rats, and there was no
remarkable PIAS1 staining in either the untreated SAP or Ad5/
F35-vector treated rats (Fig. 1B and C).
3.2. Histological changes of pancreatic and lung tissue

Lung tissue from control rats showed a normal structure and no
histopathological changes under a light microscope. In untreated
SAP and Ad5/F35-vector treated rats, the lung tissue stained with
H&E indicated a widespread increase in alveolar wall thickness
caused by edema, severe hemorrhage in the alveolus, alveolus col-
lapse and obvious inflammatory cell infiltration. In the Ad5/F35-
PIAS1 treated rats, the histopathological changes of lung tissue
were minor compared with those in the untreated SAP and Ad5/
F35-vector treated rats, especially for hemorrhage in the alveolus
(Fig. 2A). The infiltration of neutropils and mononuclear cells,
interstitial edema and focal necrotic areas were seen in the pancre-
atic tissue of both untreated SAP and Ad5/F35-vector treated rats.
The morphological changes in pancreatic tissue of Ad5/F35-PIAS1
treated rats included intralobular edema, inflammatory infiltrate,
and acinar cell necrosis, but these were greatly reduced (character-
ized only by slightly interstitial edema), and without obvious
parenchyma necrosis and hemorrhage. There were no observable
pancreatitis pathologic changes in control rats (Fig. 2B).

The severity of pancreatic injury in rats based on histological
score of pancreatic injury, the ratio of wet /dry weight of pancreatic
tissue and serum amylase levels, are summarized in Table 1. The
results showed that the levels of these markers for inflammation
were significantly lower in Ad5/F35-PIAS1 treated rats as com-
pared to those of the untreated SAP and Ad5/F35-vector treated
rats (P < 0.01). However, the histological score of pancreatic injury
and serum amylase levels in the Ad5/F35-PIAS1 treated rats were
higher than for the control rats (P < 0.01). The levels of the
above-mentioned markers showed no statistically significant dif-
ference between the untreated SAP and Ad5/F35-vector treated
rats (P > 0.05).

The tests for levels of severity of lung injury in rats, including
the histological score of lung injury and the ratio of wet/dry weight
of lung tissue, are summarized in Table 2. Compared to the control
rats, the histological score of lung injury and ratio of wet/dry
weight of lung were significantly increased in both the untreated
SAP and Ad5/F35-vector treated rats (P < 0.01). The increase in his-
tological score of lung injury and ratio of wet/dry weight of lung
was significantly reduced in the Ad5/F35-PIAS1 treated rats
(P < 0.01) compared to either untreated SAP or Ad5/F35-vector
treated rats, although still higher than in the control rats
(P < 0.01). The levels of the above-mentioned markers showed no
statistical difference between the untreated SAP and Ad5/F35-
vector treated rats (P > 0.05).
3.3. Detection of inflammatory response of lung

The MPO activity and concentrations of MDA in the lung were
increased in the untreated SAP and Ad5/F35-vector treated rats
compared to that of the controls rats (P < 0.01, respectively), but
there was no significant different between the SAP and Ad5/F35-

vector treated rats (P > 0.05). However, in Ad5/F35-PIAS1 treated
rats, the upregulation of PIAS1 protein markedly decreased the
MPO activity and MDA concentration (vs. the untreated SAP and
Ad5/F35-vector treated rats, P < 0.01; vs. the control rats, P > 0.05,
respectively). The number of neutrophils in BALF showed increases
in rats who received the untreated SAP and Ad5/F35-vector treat-
ment, as compared with that seen in the lungs of Ad5/F35-PIAS1
treated and control rats (P < 0.01). There were no significant differ-
ence between the untreated SAP and Ad5/F35-vector treated rats
(P > 0.05) (Table 3).
3.4. Comparison of serum TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6 and IL-10 levels

The TNF-a, IL-1band IL-6 serum levels were significantly de-
creased in Ad5/F35-PIAS1 treated rats in comparison with those
of SAP and Ad5/F35-vector treated rats (P < 0.01), and there was
no difference between the Ad5/F35-PIAS1 treated and control rats
(P > 0.05). In addition, the serum levels of TNF-a, IL-1band IL-6
showed no significant difference between the untreated SAP and
Ad5/F35-vector treated rats (P > 0.05). Anti-inflammatory cytokine
IL-10 levels were greatly deceased in untreated SAP rats compared
to control rats (P < 0.01), and were also lower in Ad5/F35-PIAS1 or
Ad5/F35-vector treated rats than control rats (P < 0.01, respec-
tively). There was no difference in IL-10 levels in Ad5/F35-PIAS1
or Ad5/F35-vector treated rats compared to that of untreated SAP
rats (P > 0.05) (Table 4).
3.5. Pulmonary expression of inflammatory-regulated mediators

Western blot analysis of inflammatory-regulated mediators is
shown in Fig. 3. To gain direct evidence for the mechanism leading
to the reduction of the inflammatory response of lung induced by
PIAS1 in rat with SAP, we determined the levels of un-phosphory-
lated and phosphorylated STAT1 protein in lung tissue. The phos-
phorylation of STAT1 protein (as assayed with P-STAT 1
antibody) in the lungs of untreated SAP and Ad5/F35-vector trea-
ted rats was enhanced compared to that of control rats (P < 0.01).
In contrast, the treatment of SAP rats with Ad5/F35-PIAS1 led to
the abrogation of phosphorylation of the STAT1 protein (P < 0.01,
compared to untreated SAP and Ad/F35-vector treated rats), there

was no difference in this regard when compared with the control
rats (P > 0.05). However, the un-P-STAT1 protein levels (as assayed
with STAT 1 antibody) for all SAP-induced rats were higher
compared to that of control rats (P < 0.01). ICAM-1 protein expres-
sion in the lung revealed that its 85-kDa protein expression levels
were increased in the untreated SAP and Ad5/F35-vector treated
rats, compared with either the Ad5/F35-PIAS1 treated or control
rats (P < 0.01). Moreover, the increase of MMP-9 protein expression
in lung was much more marked in the untreated SAP and Ad5/F35-
vector treated rats compared to that of the Ad5/F35-PIAS1 treated
and control rats (P < 0.01). The levels of ICAM-1 and MMP-9 pro-
teins showed no difference between either the Ad5/F35-PIAS1
treated and control rats or between the Ad5/F35-vector treated
and untreated SAP rats (P > 0.05).
3.6. Survival study

The average survival time of SAP-induced rats receiving Ad5/
F35-PIAS1 was 31.70 ± 5.16 h (95% confidence interval (CI):
21.47–41.82). The average survival time of SAP-induced rats
receiving Ad5/F35-vector was 19.80 ± 4.17 h (95% CI: 11.62–
27.97). As for the untreated SAP rats, the average survival time
was 18.70 ± 4.19 h (95% CI: 10.48–26.91). The 48 h survival rate
was significantly improved in SAP rats with Ad5/F35-PIAS1 treat-
ment compared with the untreated SAP and Ad5/F35-vector
treated rats (P < 0.05). No statistically significant difference was
seen in the survival rate between the untreated SAP and Ad5/
F35-vector treated rats (Fig. 4).
4. Discussion

The use of Ad5-based gene therapy offers several significant
advantages over the administration of recombinant proteins. For
example, the pretreatment of mice with Ad5 delivery-IL-10 re-
duced weight loss, attenuated the release of inflammatory cyto-
kines, and reduced mortality in mice with sepsis; pretreatment
with a control Ad5 delivery did not significantly exacerbate the
inflammatory response. The results suggest that the injection of
Ad5 delivery-IL-10 could reduce the severity of sepsis in rats
[16]. Therefore, the gene transfer has been proposed as a novel
method to produce cytokine inhibitors or antagonists in inflamma-
tion, in the present study the delivery of adenovirus-based gene
was used for the severe inflammatory disease SAP to explore its ef-
fect of action.

Expression with Ad5 vectors is rapid, with appearance of the
protein usually occurring within hours; peak expression occurs
within 1–3 days after Ad5 instillation [16]. Some studies were per-
formed in which the Ad5-delivered gene therapy was administered
before the onset of the inflammatory state [17,18]. Recently, a hy-
brid Ad5 vector was developed, in which the fiber protein from
Ad35 was substituted for the original fiber. This vector binds in a
Coxsackie virus and adenovirus receptor (CAR)-independent man-
ner, and has successfully been used to infect suspension cells. And
the ability of Ad5/F35 to deliver transgenes to cells with high
efficiency and low toxicity provides an improved means of study-
ing the consequences of transient gene expression in cells [19].

This study explored the effect of using Ad5/F35-based gene
therapy to deliver PIAS1 in SAP-induced rats. Firstly, the time to
administrate Ad5/F35-PIAS1 seems to be very important, since it
takes time to transfect and express protein. The route and time
course of Ad5/F35 delivery to these animals was based on previous
studies that have also been shown that cytokine production after
the administration of Ad5-cytokine gene persists for 4 days [20].
According to the results of PIAS1 protein expression, the current
study demonstrates that Ad5/F35 transfer of PIAS1 is an effective
method to transfect the pancreas and lung for up to 3 days in rats
when delivered by IV injection. The expression of PIAS1 protein in
lung and pancreatic tissue was greatly increased in rats who were
treated with Ad5/F35-PIAS1 on day 2 before SAP induction com-
pared to those treated 10 min or 1 day prior to SAP induction.
Therefore, the rats received with Ad5/F35-PIAS1 on day 2 before
SAP induction was used for future investigation. And these findings
represent the first demonstration of prophylactic strategy of Ad5/
F35 gene transfer in experimental SAP. Secondly, the early inter-
vention is necessary in the treatment of SAP, since SAP develops
fast and the consequent systemic responses will increase mortality,
thus making therapies more difficult and more costly. Here, we
presented the first evidence that early prophylactic administration
of Ad5F35-PIAS1 could ameliorate the extent of injury of pancre-
atic tissue in SAP-induced rats and decrease mortality. Thirdly,
the administration of the Ad5F35-vector had no effect on the injury

extent of pancreatic tissue in SAP-induced rats. Finally, because of
the results mentioned above, it was necessary to further evaluate
the effective mechanisms of up-regulation of PIAS1 on SAP-in-
duced rats associated with ALI.

ALI is an important problem affecting the severity of SAP [21]. It
is believed that the excess production of inflammatory mediators
released by macrophages, neutrophils and other cells of the im-
mune system in a cascade network is the underlying mechanism
causing ALI in SAP [22,23]. As SAP progresses, neutrophils are also
transmigrated across endothelial surfaces and into the tissues by
inflammatory mediator induction, where they exert their toxic ef-
fects, resulting in microvascular dysfunction and local inflamma-
tory response. These responses include microvascular disorder,
alveolar capillary barrier leakage, interstitial and alveolar edema,
and eventual cell death [24,25].

The wet weigh/dry weight ratios of lung tissue for each group
were measured for assessment of changes in lung vascular perme-
ability. This study found that the Ad5/F35-PIAS1 treated rats
showed a much lower ratio of wet to dry weight in lungs than in
the untreated SAP rats. Furthermore, when compared to the un-
treated SAP and Ad5/F35-vector treated rats, the Ad5/F35-PIAS1
treated rats had lower scores for lung injury, including measure-
ments of alveolar congestion, hemorrhage, infiltration or aggrega-
tion of neutrophils in airspace or vessel wall, and thickness of the
alveolar wall. According to the MPO assay measurement of neutro-
phil accumulation, and the BALF count of neutrophils, the un-
treated SAP rats had a higher neutrophil accumulation than
either the control or Ad5/F35-PIAS1 treated rats. MDA is one of
the final products of lipid peroxidation, and its concentration is di-
rectly proportional to the cell damage caused by reactive oxygen
metabolites [26]. In the present study, the increase in pulmonary
MDA production following SAP induction was reduced by Ad5/
F35-PIAS1 prophylactic administration, suggesting that Ad5/F35-
PIAS1 is involved in an anti-inflammatory effect. These results lend
support to the use of Ad5/F35-PIAS1 as an anti-inflammatory ther-
apy for SAP associated with ALI.

The STAT1 signaling pathway, one of the most important intra-
cellular signaling pathways in mammals, is involved in the regula-
tion of the inflammatory response. Various forms of stimuli can
activate it and thereafter the phosphorylation of STAT1 regulates
a variety of downstream proteins. Many studies have shown that
STAT1 regulates the transcription of cytokine genes [27]. Our
previous studies found that there was a positive interaction be-
tween the activity of STAT1, which regulates the expression of
inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a, IL-1b and IL-6, and the
severity of SAP. The inhibitor of STAT1 (Rapamycin) decreased
the levels of these inflammatory cytokines, thus lessening the
severity of SAP (Un-published data).

Meanwhile, TNF-a and IL-1b are important inflammatory cyto-
kines participating in the pathogenesis of SAP, directly injuring
cells and causing necrosis, inflammation and edema [28]. IL-6 is
a multifunctional cytokine released by macrophages and is an
accurate early predictor of acute pancreatitis severity, with a sen-
sitivity range of 89–100% [29]. The current study found that the
early administration of Ad5/F35-PIAS1 might block the induction
of TNF-a and IL-1b. Previous study has also shown that IL-10 is
an important anti-inflammatory cytokine and plays a role as a
self-defense mechanism, limiting the intensity of the inflammatory
process. Several studies concluded that IL-10 plays an important
protective role for pancreatic cell injury in SAP [30], but Ad5/
F35-PIAS1 gene prophylactic administration had no significant
influence on the release of IL-10 in the course SAP in this study.

As secondary chemotactic factors of inflammatory-regulated
mediators, ICAM-1 and MMP-9 initiate a cascade reaction, accumu-
late neutrophilic leukocytes and stimulate the production of reac-
tive oxygen species and other pro-inflammatory factors, attack
and degrade membranes, damage membrane stability and causes
lung vascular permeability [31–33]. In our experiments, the ele-
vated levels of ICAM-1 and MMP-9 were found in SAP. The Ad5/
F35-vector were administered IV have no significantly promotion
in lung inflammation were observed in this study. Furthermore,
the pretreatment of Ad5/F35-PIAS1 was able to inhibit the activa-
tion of STAT1, down-regulated the levels of downstream inflamma-
tory-regulated mediators including ICAM-1 and MMP-9. As these
mediators are known mediators of inflammatory injury, the reduc-
tion in their levels may be important in attenuating the endothelial
permeability of lung tissue and lessening the severity of ALI of SAP.
These findings suggest that pretreatment with Ad5/F35-based gene
therapy expressing PIAS1 can be safely performed during acute
inflammation and can reduce the magnitude of the subsequent
inflammatory process. As a final result, the survival time was pro-
longed in Ad5/F35-PIAS1 treated rats compared with SAP rats.

In our study, the results suggest that the prophylactic adminis-
tration of PIAS1 inhibited the activation of STAT1 and down-
regulated downstream inflammatory cytokines, relieved endothe-
lial permeability, attenuated ALI and increased the survival rate
in SAP-induced rats. PIAS1 also inhibited the inflammation and
lessened the pancreatic injury of SAP. It might be helpful to use
PIAS1 in SAP as a therapeutic strategy for the future experiment
and we believe this study will be particularly relevant to clinical
settings.

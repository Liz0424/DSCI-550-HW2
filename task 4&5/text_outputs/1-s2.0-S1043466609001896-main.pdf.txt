Aim: Increased production of cytokines and chemokines in serum and tissues upon oxidative stress
caused by severe systemic infections are the major cause of sepsis. Aldose reductase (AR) known to medi-
ate oxidative stress-induced NF-jB activation and transcription of cytokines and chemokines are the
main mediator of bacterial endotoxin-induced inflammatory response. Our aim is to investigate the effect
of AR inhibitors on the prevention of inflammatory cytokines in the cecum ligation and puncture (CLP)
model of polymicrobial sepsis which closely mimics the sepsis syndrome in humans. Results: Mice were
rendered septic by CLP in the absence and presence of AR inhibitor, sorbinil. The levels of cytokines, che-
mokines and other inflammatory markers in the plasma, peritoneal fluid and heart of mice were signif-
icantly inhibited by sorbinil. Inhibition of AR also prevented CLP-induced COX-2, iNOS and HMGB-1 in
heart, kidney and spleen. Conclusions: Our results showed that the inhibition of AR significantly prevented
the polymicrobial sepsis-induced increase in inflammatory markers and thus indicate the use of AR inhib-
itors as anti-inflammatory agents.

1. Introduction

Sepsis is a serious medical condition that results in increased
fatalities in elderly, immunocompromised and critically ill intu-
bated patients [1]. This disease is characterized by whole-body
inflammation due to severe systemic infection [2]. Severely burnt
patients usually develop sepsis which is the major cause of death
if not aggressively and timely treated [3]. In the United States
alone, sepsis is the second leading cause of death in non-coronary
intensive care unit patients [4], which account for 20–50% deaths
per year out of 660,000 affected cases [5]. Despite significant ad-
vances in the understanding of pathogenesis of sepsis and its com-
plications, barely a small number of restorative strategies have
been employed that could decrease mortality associated with sep-
tic shock. Although sepsis is generally initiated by a bacterial infec-
tion, the pathogenesis of sepsis is characterized by increased levels
of inflammatory markers such as cytokines and chemokines that
could lead to severe complications such as multiorgan failure and
death [6]. Eventhough the treatment with broad range antibiotics
is generally effective in killing the replicating bacteria, the dead
bacterial cell wall components act as bacterial toxins which cause
overwhelming systemic inflammatory response [7]. Thus control-

ling bacterial infection is not sufficient to treat sepsis. It is rather
important to neutralize the immunogenic signals that activate
transcription factors that transcribe inflammatory markers.
Although several new therapeutic strategies have been described
in the literature for the treatment of sepsis to date, various anti-
inflammatory strategies have produced only modest therapeutic
effects in critically ill sepsis patients [8].

Recently, we have shown that the treatment with aldose
reductase (AR) inhibitors results in profoundly improved survival
in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced endotoximia in mice [9].
The observed improvement in survival after treatment with AR
inhibitors or AR-siRNA was associated with restoration of cardiac
muscle contractility and cardiac functions. We have demonstrated
that a significant increase in the levels of serum as well as heart
cytokines, chemokines and other inflammatory markers such as
COX-2, iNOS and PGE2 in LPS-treated mice which significantly
contributes to pathophysiology of sepsis, was markedly prevented
by AR inhibition [9]. Also inhibition of AR prevented the endo-
toxin, high glucose and TNF-a induced increase in the redox-sen-
sitive transcription factors, NF-jB and AP-1, which are known to
transcribe various inflammatory markers [9–15]. These results
suggest that AR inhibitors, developed as anti-diabetic drugs, could
be used as therapeutic intervention to prevent sepsis [16]. AR
inhibitors such as zopolrestat, fidarestat have been found to be
safe and passed in FDA’s phase-II and clinical trials for diabetic
neuropathy but failed in phase-III clinical trials as they have been
shown to be not as effective. There are several AR inhibitors such

as ranirestat that are still undergoing phase-III trails for diabetic
neuropathy. An AR inhibitor, epalrestat is available in Japan
mainly to treat patients with diabetic neuropathy [16,17]. Our re-
cent results demonstrate that AR inhibitors could be used thera-
peutically for inflammatory disorders other than diabetic
complications [15,18]. For such use a careful examination of the
effect of AR inhibition in clinically relevant animal models is
mandatory. In the present study, we investigated whether treat-
ment with AR inhibitors could prevent alterations in the cytokine
and chemokine levels in a clinically more relevant model that
mimics sepsis conditions in humans. Our results indicate that
AR inhibitor is a powerful repressor of the expression of major
cytokines and chemokines in a mouse model of polymicrobial
sepsis indicating its use as potential anti-inflammatory agent in
sepsis and associated complications.
2. Materials and methods

2.1. Materials

Antibodies against COX-2, iNOS p65-NF-jB and HMGB-1 were
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotech, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibod-
ies against AR were custom raised and tested for specificity. Mouse
specific ELISA kits for cytokines were purchased from BD biosci-
ences (Franklin Lakes, NJ). Cytokine antibody array was purchased
from RayBiotech, Inc. (Norcross, GA). Sorbinil was gift from Pfizer
(Groton, CT). ACTICHROME� Tissue factor activity assay kit was
purchased from American diagnostic Inc (Stamford, CT), Tramadol
Hydrochloride from Mallinckrodt Inc. (St. Louis, MO). All other re-
agents were of the highest purity available.
2.2. Cecim ligation and puncture procedure

BALB/c female mice (19–23 g) were obtained from Jackson lab-
oratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and housed with regular diet and ambi-
ence for 48 h before recruiting to the study. The animals were
maintained in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals published by the National Institutes of Health
and in accordance with the Institute’s ‘‘Guideline of the Animal
Care and Use Committee”. Using previously described method
[19] CLP procedure was performed by anesthetizing the mice with
ketamine (60 lg/g) and xylazine (10 lg/g) and a 2-cm midline inci-
sion was made through the linea alba. The cecum was located, li-
gated with sterile 3–0, silk, and perforated with double puncture
using a 18-gauge needle. A small amount of stool was extruded
to ensure wound potency. Sham-treated mice also had surgery
done along with cecal manipulations but without ligation and
puncture. The cecum was then replaced in its original position
within the abdomen, and incision was immediately closed. Soon
after surgery, each mouse received a subcutaneous injection of
1 ml of warm (37 �C) normal saline with traMADOL hydrochloride
(20 lg/g body wt). To inhibit AR, mice received 25 mg/kg body wt
sorbinil 2 h after surgery and then 6 h after surgery. All mice (5 in
each group) were kept at 22 �C and killed after 14 h of surgery.
Blood was collected from the heart in EDTA-coated tubes. Plasma
was separated from cellular components by centrifugation at
600g for 5 min and stored at �20 �C. For peritoneal lavage, 2 cm
skin was removed leaving the peritoneal membrane intact. Then
1 ml of ice-cold 1� Hanks balanced salt solution (without CaCl2,
MgCl2, Mg2SO4, and phenol red; GIBCO) was injected using 26
gauge needle. After injection, peritoneum was gently palpated for
30 s, and peritoneal fluid was aspirated out using a 20 gauge nee-
dle. The fluid was centrifuged (600g, 5 min), and the supernatant
was stored at �20 �C. Heart and aorta tissues were collected and
stored at �70 �C for tissue homogenates.

2.3. Measurement of cytokines in plasma

Mice after 14 h of surgery were euthanized and blood was col-
lected into EDTA-coated vacutainers by heart puncture. plasma
was separated by centrifugation at 600g for 5 min. Levels of IL-
1b, IL-6, TNF-a and MCP-1 in the plasma were measured by using
respective mouse specific ELISA kits according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions. Known concentrations of standards were used
to generate the standard curves. The reaction was initiated by the
addition of 0.1 ml of the serum, stopped and read at 450 nm on an
ELISA plate reader. The results obtained are expressed as pg/ml of
the plasma.

2.4. Measurement of cytokines and chemokines in heart

To measure the expression of cytokines and chemokines in
heart tissue homogenates, we used commercially available RayBio
Mouse cytokine antibody array system that determines the expres-
sion of 64 inflammatory markers from a single sample by following
manufacturer’s instructions. In-brief, 100 lg heart tissue homoge-
nates were incubated with array support membrane where the
membrane was specifically coated with antigens to capture an ar-
ray of cytokines. The tagged proteins were detected by conjugating
with biotinylated antibodies and streptavidin system. Fold change
was calculated from the measured intensities of the individual
spots signal developed on X-ray film using Kodak-densitometry
software.

2.5. Western blot analysis

To examine the effect of AR inhibition on CLP-induced expres-
sion of COX-2, iNOS, AR, NF-jB and HMGB-1 we homogenized
heart, spleen and kidney tissues obtained from euthanized mice
after 14 h of CLP procedure. Equal amount of protein from homog-
enates were subjected to SDS–PAGE and Western blotting and
membranes were probed for against specific antibodies AR, iNOS,
pP65-NF-jB, COX-2, HMG-1 (HMGB-1) and GAPDH. The antigen–
antibody complexes were detected by enhanced chemilumines-
cence (Pierce, Rockford, IL). All blots were probed with GAPDH as
a loading control and densitometric analysis was carried out by
using Kodak Image station.

2.6. Tissue factor assay

Tissue factor was measured in mice plasma by using ACTI-
CHROME� Tissue factor activity assay kit from American diagnostic
Inc. by following manufacturer’s protocol. In-brief After the exper-
imental procedure mice plasma were collected as described in
methods and the reaction was initiated by adding equal amount
of plasma to reaction mixture containing lapidated tissue factor,
factor VIII and factor X, allowing to form complex with fVIIa to gen-
erate TF/fVIIa complexes and convert fX into fXa. fXa cleaves the
chromogenic substrate and the formation of color is measured by
reading absorbance at 409 nm using micro well plate reader.
Amount of tissue factor in the sample were calculated using the
standards. The results obtained were measured in pMoles.

2.7. Statistical analysis

Data are presented as mean ± SEM and the p values were deter-
mined using the one-way ANOVA and unpaired Student’s t-test.

3. Results

3.1. Prevention of CLP-induced increase in plasma and peritoneal
cytokines by AR inhibition

To investigate the effect of AR inhibition on polymicrobial infec-
tion-induced inflammatory response, we performed CLP-surgery on
mice injected without or with AR inhibitor, sorbinil. Increased red-
ness around the cecum caused by increased blood flow due to dila-
tory expansion of microcirculatory blood vessels observed in the
CLP operated mice was prevented by AR inhibitor (Fig. 1). The plasma
and peritoneal fluids were collected 14 h after CLP procedure and
analyzed for cytokines and chemokines. The plasma and peritoneal
fluid levels of IL-1b, IL-6, TNF-a and MCP-1 proteins in sham-oper-
ated controls were low but detectable (Fig. 2A–D, left panel). How-
ever in the CLP mice the plasma levels of TNF-a, IL-6, IL-1b and
MCP-1 increased by approximately �0.8-, 37-, 11- and 10-folds,
respectively (Fig. 2A–D, left panel). On the other hand, administra-
tion of sorbinil to the CLP mice significantly (�45–80%) prevented
the increase in the plasma levels of cytokines and chemokines. Sim-
ilarly, in CLP mice the peritoneal fluid levels of TNF-a, IL-6, IL-1b and
MCP-1 increased by 5.2-, 31-, 10- and 5-folds, respectively (Fig. 2A–
D, right panel) and administration of sorbinil to the CLP mice signif-
icantly (�40–70%) prevented the increase in cytokine levels. AR
inhibitors alone had no effect on the basal levels of these cytokines
and chemokines in plasma or peritoneal fluid. Further, the measure-
ment of inflammatory cytokines (such as TNF-a, IL-1, IL-6) in the ser-
um at 3 h after CLP-surgery did not cause any increase in the
cytokine levels as compared to controls and AR inhibitor treated
mice (data not shown). These results suggest that AR inhibition
could prevent polymicrobial infection-induced systemic production
of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in mice.

3.2. Prevention of CLP-induced increase in tissue cytokines by AR
inhibition

Since increased cardiac dysfunction and cardiomyopathy due
to augmented local production of inflammatory cytokines and
Fig. 1. AR inhibition prevents CLP-induced redness around the wound: after 14 h of CLP
pictures were taken immediately after the opening of wound. The region showing redn
chemokines are the major cause of mortality and morbidity ob-
served in patients with sepsis [20], we specifically examined
the effect of AR inhibition on CLP-induced cytokines and che-
mokines in the mice hearts. We used an antibody array that
determines the expression of 64 cytokines and chemokines
and other inflammatory markers from a single sample
(Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3, the levels of MIP-2, MIP-1 and
lymphotoxin increased by �6-fold in CLP mice group whereas
the increase was only �3-fold in case of CLP + sorbinil group.
Similarly the levels of other cytokines and chemokines were
significantly elevated in CLP group of mice and administration
of AR inhibitor significantly prevented these cytokines and che-
mokines (Fig. 3B).

We next determined the effect of AR inhibition on the CLP-in-
duced levels of inflammatory markers COX-2, iNOS and HMGB-1
in heart, spleen and kidney homogenates by Western blot anal-
ysis (Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 4A and B, polymicrobial sepsis
caused �3.5-, �2.5-fold induction of COX-2 and iNOS respec-
tively which was significantly (�90%) prevented by the adminis-
tration of AR inhibitor. Similarly in CLP mice tissue homogenates,
a significant increase in AR protein was observed and inhibitors
of AR prevented CLP-induced increase in the expression of AR
protein (Fig. 4C). Since the expression of cytokines and chemo-
kines, COX-2, iNOS and AR depends on the activation of NF-jB,
we next measured the activated form of NF-jB in mice heart,
spleen and kidney homogenates. As shown in Fig. 4D the CLP-in-
duced activation of NF-jB in mice tissue homogenates was sig-
nificantly prevented by AR inhibition. Since activated
macrophages and monocytes secrete HMGB-1 protein which acts
as a mediator of inflammation [21], we next measured the effect
of AR inhibition on the expression of HMGB-1. As shown in
Fig. 4E, increased expression of HMGB-1 protein was observed
in CLP tissues as compared to sham controls and ARI treatment
significantly prevented CLP-induced HMGB-1. These results sug-
gested that AR inhibition could prevent CLP-induced inflamma-
tion by inhibiting redox-sensitive transcription factor, NF-jB –
dependent expression of various inflammatory markers such as
cytokines and chemokines.

3.3. Prevention of CLP-induced activation of plasmatissue factor by AR
inhibition

Previous studies have shown that the use of anti-coagulants
would be beneficial in preserving platelets and organ functions in
endotoxemia-model via mechanisms involving inactivation of tis-
sue factor, which plays a critical role in the initiation of complex
mechanisms in the process of blood clot which causes organ dys-
function [22]. We therefore, measured the activation of tissue fac-
tor in CLP mice plasma. Our results (Fig. 5) show that tissue factor
activity was much higher in CLP group as compared to CLP + ARI
group of mice as well as sham-operated control mice indicating
that inhibition of AR could prevent secretion of tissue factor.

4. Discussion

Polymicrobial sepsis is a serious medical condition character-
ized by shock, hypoxemia, and organ dysfunction and dissemi-
nated intravascular coagulation [1,23]. Although subjects of all
age groups upon severe bacterial infections can get sepsis, higher
mortality has been observed in overweight, older age, intubated
and immunocompromised patients [5]. Severe sepsis results from
the body’s systemic over-response to infection that disrupts
homeostasis through an uncontrolled cascade of inflammation
[24], blood coagulation and impaired fibriolysis [21]. Even though
controlling bacterial infections by aggressive antibiotics therapy
and maintaining homeostasis in immune response saves a num-
ber of lives, 20–25% patients die because of multiorgan failure
[4,5,25]. Although precise mechanism(s) of multiorgan failure is
not clearly understood, several clinical models have been devel-
oped to investigate the mechanism(s) involved in sepsis patho-
genesis [26]. Among them, CLP-model has been shown to
closely replicate the nature and course of clinical sepsis. This
model is highly reproducible and widely used to study the mech-
aninsm(s) of multiorgan failure as well as for testing the efficacy
of drugs [27].

Uncontrolled generation of proinflammatory cytokines and che-
mokines has been noted in experimental models of sepsis as well
as in clinical settings. Early release of macrophage-derived proin-
flammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a, IL-6, IL-1b and MCP-1 have
been shown to be important in the pathogenesis of septic shock
and multiorgan failure [28–31]. In our study, AR inhibitor adminis-
tration resulted in a significant decrease in these proinflammatory
cytokines not only in the plasma and peritoneal fluids but in the
heart as well. Thus the ability of AR inhibited mice to produce less
inflammatory cytokines in response to CLP-induced sepsis could
indicate the potential use of AR inhibitors in prevention of sepsis
and its associated complications. It is well known that under oxida-
tive stress-induced by infections, bacterial toxins and during vari-
ous pathological conditions NF-jB is significantly activated which
regulates the expression of genes involved in inflammatory re-
sponses [10,18]. The mechanisms by which AR inhibition exerts
an inhibitory effect on proinflammatory cytokine levels may in-
volve the suppression of NF-jB activity [11,29]. In fact, several re-
ports suggest that inhibition of NF-jB could prevent inflammatory
response observed in sepsis. For example, anti-oxidants such as N-
acetylcystene, ascorbic acid, and a-tocopherol [32–35] which pre-
vent the activation of ROS-induced NF-jB have been shown to pro-
tect animals and humans from septic shock. We have recently
shown that AR inhibitors which act like anti-oxidants and prevent
bacterial endotoxin, LPS- induced generation of ROS prevent the
activation of NF-jB and the expression of inflammatory markers
in macrophages as well as in mice serum [9,12–14]. We have
shown that AR-catalyzed reduced products of lipid aldehyde gluta-
thione conjugates such as GS-DHN could mediate the signaling
pathway that eventually increases transcription of inflammatory
markers in vascular smooth muscle cells and other cells [14]. The
increased cytokines, chemokines and growth factors subsequently
initiate the signal transduction pathways that result in increased
secretion of inflammatory markers which cause inflammation
and multiorgan failure. Our cellular studies using vascular smooth
muscle cells, vascular endothelial cells and macrophages have
demonstrated that ROS-induced NF-jB activation and transcrip-
tion of inflammatory markers such as TNF-a, IL-1b, COX-2 and
iNOS can be prevented by inhibiting AR [10–15]. In the present
study also our results indicate that the release of bacteria into
the peritoneum by CLP procedure causes a significant increase in
various inflammatory markers in the peritoneal fluid which is sig-
nificantly prevented by AR inhibitor. Since several of the AR inhib-
itors have been found to be safe and have already been studied for
phase-1 and phase-2 clinical trails for diabetic neuropathy [16,17],
the use of AR inhibitors as anti-inflammatory drug would be less
time consuming and if found as effective in humans as in experi-
mental model of sepsis, they could be used therapeutically in the
inflammatory disorder patients. In summary, our results suggest
that the AR inhibition has anti-inflammatory effects in murine
model of sepsis. Further studies are required to use AR inhibition
as an excellent therapeutic approach to treat sepsis especially
those patients in which antibiotics though kill the bacteria, the cir-

culating bacterial toxins including bacterial wall that takes several
days to clear from the tissues cause fatal inflammatory disorders.

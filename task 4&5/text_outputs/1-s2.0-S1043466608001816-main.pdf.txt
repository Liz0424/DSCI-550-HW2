We demonstrated that TNF-a suppressed differentiation and potentiated cell death induced by buty-
rate (NaBt) in both adenocarcinoma HT-29 and fetal FHC human colon cells in vitro. Since TNF-a is a
typical activator of NF-jB pathway, we studied the role of NF-jB activation in cell differentiation
and death during the TNF-a and NaBt co-treatment. TNF-a induced rapid NF-jB activation in both
HT-29 and FHC cell lines and this effect was differently modulated by NaBt in these two cell lines.
In HT-29 cells, NaBt potentiated NF-jB activity induced by TNF-a after 4 h treatment. However, this
initial potentiation of NF-jB activity was not observed in FHC cells. During additional time of TNF-a
and NaBt co-treatment, NaBt decreased the TNF-a-mediated NF-jB activity in both cell types. We
also detected a different response of HT-29 and FHC cells after the pre-treatment with the NF-jB
inhibitor parthenolide. Our results indicated that NaBt-mediated differentiation and apoptosis of
colon epithelial cells can be modulated by TNF-a. Furthermore, we found significant differences in
the mechanism of the NaBt and TNF-a co-treatment effects between cells of non-cancer and cancer
origin, suggesting that the NF-jB pathway may be more effectively involved in these processes in
cancer cells.

1. Introduction

The colon epithelial cells are under the influence of many sub-
stances originating either from endogenous sources or from the
diet. Above all, the quantity and ratio of lipids and fiber content
in the diet are among the most important factors. Mutual interac-
tion of endogenous and dietary substances may influence colorec-
tal epithelium in various ways. They can encourage a rise of
infectious and inflammatory diseases or cancer of the intestine
and, on the other hand, they may contribute to regeneration of in-
jured tissue or disease therapy [1,2].

Short-chain fatty acid butyrate is formed in the gastrointestinal
tract of mammals as a result of anaerobic bacterial fermentation of
dietary fiber [3,4]. It modulates proliferation and induces differen-
tiation and apoptosis of colon epithelial cells [5,3], both in vivo and
in vitro, at concentrations of approximately 5 mM [6]. Butyrate can
also act as an energy source for the colonocytes. It has paradoxical
effects on colonic epithelial proliferation—stimulates proliferation
of normal crypt cells and inhibits growth of colon cancer cells
[7]. Thus, butyrate contributes significantly to the balance between
the cytokinetic processes of epithelial cells in the colon crypts.

TNF-a, an endogenously produced cytokine of the TNF family,
belongs to the intensively investigated biologically active sub-
stances [8]. It plays a crucial role in immune and inflammatory
processes, endotoxic shock, and regulation of cell growth and
death [9,10]. NNF-a is synthesized by macrophages and other
cells in response to bacterial toxins, inflammatory products and
other invasive stimuli. It has been suggested that a gut with ac-
tive injury contains an increased number of NNF-a-secreting
cells [11]. Endogenous TNF-a at levels higher than those in the
corresponding normal colorectal tissues have also been detected
in extracts of colorectal tumor tissues resected from human pa-
tients [12,13].

The proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a, are typical
activators of the canonical NF-jB signaling cascade, which is acti-
vated in response to injury, infection, inflammation and other
stress conditions [14,15]. Butyrate has been shown to reduce
inflammation in experimental colitis in rats [16], and to decrease
proinflammatory cytokine expression in intestinal biopsies from
Crohn’s disease patients via NF-jB inactivation [17]. Therefore,
it could be used during the therapy of colorectal chronic inflam-
mations. On the other hand, it has been suggested that NF-jB
activation has anti-apoptotic effects in many cell lines [18]. In-
creased expression of IjB family proteins has also been found
in differentiated parts of the colon crypts where the cells undergo
apoptosis [19].

Transcription factors of the NF-jB family, including RelA (p65),
c-Rel, RelB, NFKB1 (p50/p105), and NFKB2 (p52/p100), regulate
hundreds of genes in the context of multiple important physiolog-
ical and pathological processes [14,20]. In most cells, NF-jB is
present as a latent, inactive inhibitor of the jB (IjB)-bound com-
plex in the cytoplasm. There are two main pathways leading to
the activation of NF-jB, namely the canonical and non-canonical
pathways or the classical and alternative pathways, respectively.
In both pathways, activation of an IjB kinase (IKK) complex is
the common upstream regulatory step. This results in phosphory-
lation-induced degradation of the IjB, which enables the NF-jB di-
mers to enter the nucleus and activate specific target gene
expression. During the canonical pathway, heterodimers of RelA
(p65) with p50, p52, or p50 homodimers are liberated by degrada-
tion of IjBs, particularly IjB-a, while p52/RelB heterodimers are
translocated to the nucleus during the non-canonical pathway
[21,15,22].

Comparing the effects of butyrate and TNF-a co-treatment be-
tween cancer and non-cancer cells in vitro (using human colon
adenocarcinoma HT-29 and fetal colon FHC cell lines) we demon-
strated that NaBt-mediated differentiation and apoptosis of colon
epithelial cells can be modulated by TNF-a. Furthermore, we inves-
tigated involvement of the activation of NF-jB transcription factor
in the mechanisms of the butyrate and TNF-a co-treatment effects.
It has been demonstrated previously that preincubation of cells
with butyrate, which induced differentiation, is able to inhibit
TNF-a-activated NF-jB translocation in colon cancer cell lines
(HT-29, CaCo-2, SW620) [23,24]. In the present study, we found
significant differences in the mechanism of the NaBt and TNF-a
co-treatment effects between cells of non-cancer and cancer origin,
suggesting that the NF-jB pathway may be more effectively in-
volved in these processes in cancer cells.
2. Materials and methods

2.1. Cell cultures

The human colon adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells and human fetal
colon FHC cells (both ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were cultured in
25 mm2 flasks (TPP; Trasadigen, Switzerland) in McCoy’s 5A med-
ium and in Dulbecco‘s modified Eagle medium (DMEM):F12 (1:1)
medium, respectively, supplemented with gentamicin (50 lg/ml;
all Sigma–Aldrich; Prague, Czech Republic) and 10% fetal bovine
serum (PAN Biotech GmbH; Aidenbach, Germany). The cultures
were maintained at 37 �C in 5% CO2 and 95% humidity. The cells
were passaged twice a week after exposure to trypsin/EDTA
(0.05/0.02%) with a plating density of 1:3. For the experiments,
cells were seeded in 40 � 10 mm or 100 � 20 mm Petri dishes, or
in 12- or 24-well plates (TPP) at a density of 5 � 104 cells/cm2.
Twenty-four hours after seeding the cells were treated with NaBt
(5 mM), TNF-a (15 ng/ml; both Sigma–Aldrich), or both, as indi-
cated in the respective experiments. For the inhibition of NF-jB
activation, the cells were pre-treated for 3 h with the inhibitor of
IKK phosphorylation parthenolide (Biomol International, LP; PA,
USA) dissolved in DMSO in a concentration of 10 (HT-29 cells) or
20 (FHC cells) lM. The cells were harvested 4, 8, 24, 48, or 72 h
after the treatments. The culture medium was not replaced during
the experiments. Epidermal growth factor (EGF; 25 ng/ml; Invitro-
gen Corporatiom; Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used as a positive control
for MAPK pathway activation.

2.2. Cell number counting

Cell growth was measured by counting the cells with a Coulter
Counter (model ZM, Coulter Electronic, Luton, UK). Floating and
adherent cells were counted separately, and the number of floating
cells was expressed as a percentage of the whole cell number.

2.3. Cell cycle distribution analysis

The cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed twice in
phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS), and fixed in 70% ethanol.
DNA was stained (37 �C; 30 min) with Vindelov’s solution (10 mM
Tris buffer, pH 8; 0.7 mg/ml RNAse; 50 lg/ml propidium iodide;
0.1% Triton X-100). The DNA content was analyzed using flow
cytometry (FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA; argon
ion laser, 488 nm for excitation). Cells (15 � 103) were acquired
for each sample and the percentage of cells in the individual cell
cycle phases was analyzed using ModFit 3.0 software (Verity Soft-
ware House, Topsham, CA). Single cells were identified and gated
by pulse-code processing of the area and the width of the signal.
Cell debris was excluded by appropriate rising of the forward scat-
ter threshold.

2.4. MTT assay

The cells were growing on 96-well plates. Ten microliters of the
2.5 mg/ml stock solution of 3-[4,5-dimethylthiasol-2yl]-2,5-diphe-
nyl-tetrasolium bromide (MTT; Sigma) was added to each well.
After 4 h of incubation at 37 �C in 5% CO2 and 95% humidity, the
medium was removed, 50 ll of the extraction buffer (10% Triton
X-100; 0.1 M HCl) was added and plates were gently shaken for
2 h at room temperature [17]. The optical densities were measured
at 570 nm (DigiScan Reader).

2.5. Fluorescence microscopy

The cells were trypsinized and 0.5–2 � 106 cells (including
floating cell population) were incubated with 40 ll of 4,6-
diamidino-2-phenyl-indole (DAPI) staining solution (3 lg DAPI/
ml of methanol) in room temperature, in the dark for 30 min,
and mounted to Mowiol. Apoptotic cells were counted using a
fluorescence microscope (OLYMPUS IX70; Olympus; Prague,
Czech Republic). The percentage of cells with the characteristic
apoptotic nuclear morphology (chromatin condensation and
fragmentation) was determined from a total number of 200
cells.

2.6. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity determination

The cells were trypsinized, 5 � 105 cells were resuspended in
500 ll of substrate buffer (10% diethanolamine; 5 mM MgCl2; pH
9.7), and lysed by sonication for 5 � 10 s using a Branson Sonifier
B-12 (Branson Ultrasonics Corp.; Danbury, CT) at a power of 30
watts. The cell lysates or alkaline phosphatase (ALP; Sigma–Al-
drich) in several concentrations (15.6–1000 � 10�6 U/well) for a
calibration curve were incubated with ALP substrate (4-p-nitro-
phenylphosphate; Fluka) in a 96-well plate (4 parallel wells in each
group) at 37 �C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 3 M
NaOH (50 ll/well) and the optical densities were measured at
405 nm by FluostarGalaxy (BMG Labtechnologies GmbH, Offen-
burg, Germany). The reading values (Units � 10�6/5 � 104 cells)
were converted to the percentage of control.

2.7. Nuclear extracts preparation

Cells grown on 100 � 20 mm Petri dishes were washed with
ice-cold PBS, scraped into tubes, and centrifuged for 10 min at
0 �C (1000g). The pellets were then incubated in a lysis buffer
(10 mM Tris base, pH 8.0, 60 mM KCl, 1.2 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT,
0.1 mM PMSF, 0.05% NP-40) for 10 min on ice and centrifuged for



M. Hýžd’alová et al. / Cytokine 44 (2008) 33–43 35
4 min at 0 �C (750g). The resulting ‘‘nuclear pellets” were rinsed
with the above lysis buffer without PMSF and NP-40. Nuclear ex-
tracts were prepared by resuspending nuclear pellets in nuclear
extraction buffer (20 mM Tris base, 420 mM NaCl, 0.7 mM MgCl2,
0.25 mM EDTA (chelate II), 25% glycerol), incubating 30 min at
4 �C, and then centrifuged for 15 min at 4 �C (13,000g). Protein con-
centration of the nuclear extracts was determined by the Bradford
assay, and stored at �80 �C until used.

2.8. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)

Double stranded NF-jB oligonucleotide (AGTTGAGGGGACTTTC
CCAGGC; VBC-Genomics GmbH; Vienna, Austria) was end-labeled
with biotin using the Biotin end-labeling kit (Pierce; Rockford, IL).
The binding reactions were performed by mixing 8 lg of the nucle-
ar extract (prepared as described above) with 0.3 lg poly-dIdC and
3 ll of the binding buffer 5� (50 mM Tris base, 6 mM EDTA (che-
late II), 0.5 mM DTT, 50% (v/v) glycerol) to give a final volume of
17 ll. After 10 min incubation in room temperature, 3 ll of
10 lM oligonucleotide was added to each reaction and the reac-
tions were incubated for an additional 30 min in room tempera-
ture. For the supershift, 1 ll of mouse anti-NF-kB p65 antibody
(#sc-8008; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; Santa Cruz, CA) was
then added to the reaction, and the mixture was incubated for
1 h in 4 �C. To control specificity of the shifts, we also used specific
competition (addition of the excess of unlabeled NF-jB oligonu-
cleotide), non-specific competition (addition of the excess of unla-
beled EBNA DNA), free probe, and the reaction mixture without the
nuclear extract. The reaction mixtures were separated in a 6.5%
polyacrylamide/TBE gel and then transferred to a nylon membrane
(Intergen; Purchase, NY). The visualization by streptavidin–horse-
radish peroxidase conjugate was performed using the LightShiftTM

Chemiluminescent EMSA Kit (Pierce).

2.9. Western blot analysis

The cells were scraped and lysed in an SDS lysis buffer (100 mM
Tris, pH 6.8; 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS); 10% glycerol). The
extracts of the total proteins were assayed with a DC protein assay
kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.; Hercules, CA). Equal amounts
(20 lg) of whole cell lysates or nuclear extracts with 0.01% brom-
phenol blue and 1% mercaptoethanol were subjected to SDS–PAGE
using 10% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were transferred to poly-
vinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.; Bedford, MA)
electrophoretically in a buffer containing 192 mM glycine, 25 mM
Tris, and 10% methanol. The membranes were blocked for 1 h in
5% powdered non-fat milk in wash buffer (0.05% Tween-20 in
20 mM Tris; pH 7.6; 140 mM NaCl). Primary antibodies (rabbit
anti-NF-jB p65, 1:500, #3034; rabbit anti-phospho-ERK1/2,
1:2000, #9101; rabbit anti-ERK1/2, 1:1000, #9102; rabbit anti-
phospho-p38, 1:2000, #9211; rabbit anti-p38, 1:1000, #9212; all
Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.; Beverly, MA; rabbit anti-I-jBa,
1:500, #sc-203, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were incubated with
the blots for 1 h at room temperature. After washing the mem-
branes in a wash buffer, secondary antibodies coupled to horserad-
ish peroxidase (anti-mouse IgG, 1:3000; #NA931 and anti-rabbit
IgG, 1:5000, #NA934, both Amersham Biosciences; Buckingham-
shire, UK) were added for 1 h. The membranes were washed and
antibody reactivity was visualized with the enhanced chemilumi-
nescence (ECL+) reagent (Amersham Biosciences) against X-ray
film-CP (Agfa-Gevaert Group; Mortsel, Belgium). The equal loading
was verified by b-actin or a-tubulin expression (mouse anti-b-ac-
tin, 1:6000, #A5441; mouse anti-a-tubulin, 1:4000, #T6074; both
Sigma) and non-specific amidoblack staining of proteins on the
membrane after immunoblotting.
2.10. Luciferase reporter construct and stable cell transfection

The reporter construct pBIIX-LUC was kindly donated by Dr. Kalle
Saksela (Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Tampere, Fin-
land). The NF-jB-driven plasmid pBIIX-LUC was constructed by
inserting a synthetic fragment with two copies of the sequence
ACA GAG GGG ACT TTC CGA GAG separated by four nucleotides
(ATCT) in front of the mouse fos promoter in plasmid pfLUC [25].

The reporter plasmid was cotransfected with pSV2neo neomycin-
resistance plasmid into HT-29 cells using electroporation (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Inc.; Hercules, CA). Briefly, approximately 1� 107 cells
was mixed with 20 lg of reporter plasmid and 2 lg of pSV2neo plas-
mid, and electroporated (275 V, 950 lF, 2� pulse). Subsequently, the
cells were seeded on a 100� 20 mm dish (TPP) with a feeder of HT-29
cells treated with mitomycin-C (5 lg/ml; Sigma–Aldrich). Neomycin
resistant clones were selected in 300 lg/ml of geneticin (G418 sulfate;
Alexis; San Diego, CA). The clones containing the reporter plasmid
were confirmed by luciferase activity assay.

2.11. Luciferase activity assay

Stably transfected cells were seeded in 12-well plates and trea-
ted 24 h later. After 4, 8, or 24 h treatment, the cells were rinsed
with PBS and then lysed with 100 ll of reagent (Luciferase Assay
System; Promega Corp.; Madison, WI). Fifty microliters of the ex-
tracts was mixed with 50 ll of luciferase substrate, and lumines-
cence was quantified by a luminometer.

2.12. Statistical analysis

All the data are expressed as the means ± SD of three indepen-
dent experiments. Differences between the groups were calculated
using one-way ANOVA. With all statistical analyses, an associated
probability (P-value) of <5% was considered as significant.

3. Results

3.1. Growth, death, and differentiation of colon epithelial cells during
TNF-a and NaBt co-treatment

3.1.1. Cell growth
Compared to control, TNF-a in a concentration of 15 ng/ml did

not significantly affect cell proliferation of both cell lines used at
any time of treatment. On the other hand, NaBt (5 mM) inhibited
cell growth in both HT-29 and FHC cell lines (Fig. 1A), but with dif-
ferent dynamics. The NaBt effect was already apparent after 24 h,
being most significant in FHC cells after 72 h (approximately 70%
decrease of cell number versus control). In HT-29 cells, NaBt inhib-
ited cell growth the most significantly after 24 and 48 h of the
treatment (approximately 40% decrease of cell number versus con-
trol), and the effect diminished after 72 h (only 20% decrease). No
additional changes of cell growth were detected after NaBt and
TNF-a co-treatment in both cell lines.

3.1.2. Cell cycle
NaBt arrested the cells in the G0/G1-phase of the cell cycle and

simultaneously decreased the proportion of cells in the S-phase
(Fig. 1B). This effect corresponded with cell growth inhibition
shown in Fig. 1A in both HT-29 and FHC cells, and was not signif-
icantly affected during co-treatment of NaBt with TNF-a. More-
over, TNF-a alone had no effect on cell cycle distribution.

3.1.3. Cell differentiation
NaBt induced a significant increase in intracellular ALP

activity (a marker of colonocyte differentiation) in both HT-

29 and FHC cells compared to untreated control (Fig. 1C).
However, the intensity of this effect varied depending on
the cell type (at the maximum 583-fold after 72 h in HT-
29 cells and 41-fold after 72 h in FHC cells). While TNF-a
alone had no effect, it significantly suppressed the NaBt-in-
duced ALP activity (approximately 3.2-fold in HT-29 cells
and 5.5-fold in FHC cells after 48 h of TNF-a and NaBt co-
treatment).

3.1.4. Cell death
In comparison to control, TNF-a did not significantly affect the

mitochondrial enzymatic activity (measured by MTT assay), per-
centage of floating cells or the number of apoptotic cells (DAPI
staining) in both cell lines used. The mitochondrial enzymatic
activity of the both HT-29 and FHC cells was decreased by NaBt
alone with the high effectiveness in cancer cells (approximately
40% decrease versus control). The effect was significantly elevated
after 72 h of NaBt and TNF-a co-treatment in both cell lines
(Fig. 2A). The percentage of floating cells was increased by NaBt

48 and 72 h of treatment. The accumulation of floating cells was
further significantly increased after co-treatment with NaBt and
TNF-a in a longer cultivation time compared to both NaBt and
TNF-a as single agents (Fig. 2B). While NaBt did not induce apop-
tosis in FHC cells, it increased the number of cells with morpholog-
ically detected apoptosis (up to 10%) of HT-29 cells (Fig. 2C).
However, after 48 or 72 h of TNF-a and NaBt co-treatment, the le-
vel of apoptosis was significantly elevated in both cancer and nor-
mal cells in comparison with NaBt and TNF-a alone.

3.2. NF-jB activation in HT-29 and FHC cells during TNF-a and NaBt
co-treatment

We investigated the role of NF-jB in the above-described ef-
fects comparing fetal FHC and cancer HT-29 cells. To study NF-
jB activation, four different approaches were used. Firstly, we
established HT-29 cell clones with a pBIIX-LUC reporter construct
for NF-jB activity detection. TNF-a induced an increase in NF-jB
activity in HT-29 cells compared with the untreated control, and
this effect was time-dependent (approximately 41- or 27-fold in-
crease after 4 h, 47- or 36-fold increase after 8 h, and 75- or 48-fold
increase after 24 h treatment in clone 3 or clone 93, respectively;
Fig. 3). Secondly, the time-dependent increase of TNF-a-induced
NF-jB binding activity in HT-29 and FHC cells was also observed
by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA; Fig. 4). Thirdly,
translocation of p65 protein into the nucleus was confirmed in nu-
clear extracts of HT-29 and FHC cells using Western blotting
(Fig. 5). Finally, expression of NF-jB inhibitory IjB-a protein was
detected in whole HT-29 and FHC cell extracts using Western blot-
ting. TNF-a induced a decrease of IjB-a expression after 4, 8, and
24 h in both cell lines (Fig. 6).

NaBt alone had no effect on NF-jB activity during a short-time
interval, but after 24 h the elevation of the activity compared to
control was apparent in both HT-29 and FHC cell lines. In HT-29
cells, this increased activity was detected by clones with the repor-
ter construct (Fig. 3), p65 protein expression in nuclear extracts
(Fig. 5), and by a decrease of IjB expression (Fig. 6). However, it
did not appear in EMSA analysis (Fig. 4). On the other hand, in
Fig. 3. NF-jB binding activity (expressed as relative luciferase activity) of two HT-29 clo
NaBt (5 mM), TNF-a (15 ng/ml; TNF), or their combination. Data are presented as mean
controls considered as 100%; §P < 0.05 (–P < 0.01) versus NaBt alone; �P < 0.05 versus TN
FHC cells the elevation of NF-jB activity mediated by NaBt 24 h
treatment was observed by all methods used except for Western
blot of p65 in nuclear extracts (Fig. 5).

After co-treatment with TNF-a and NaBt, NF-jB activity was
differently modulated in cancer and fetal cells compared to the ef-
fect of TNF-a alone. While the NF-jB binding activity (Figs. 3 and
4), its nuclear translocation (Fig. 5), and IjB degradation (Fig. 6)
were initially increased after 4 h of the TNF-a and NaBt co-treat-
ment in comparison with TNF-a alone in HT-29 cells, these effects
did not appear in FHC cells (Figs. 4–6). After 8 h of TNF-a and NaBt
co-treatment, the activity (Figs. 3 and 4) and nuclear translocation
(Fig. 5) of NF-jB and IjB degradation (Fig. 6) were similar with
that of TNF-a alone treatment in both cell lines. Finally, these
parameters were decreased after 24 h (TNF-a and NaBt co-treat-
ment compared to treatment with TNF-a alone; Figs. 3–6).

3.3. Effects of NF-jB inhibition on HT-29 and FHC cell differentiation
and apoptosis during TNF-a and NaBt co-treatment

In order to inhibit NF-jB binding activity, we searched for opti-
mal dose and time of parthenolide pre-treatment of HT-29 and FHC
cells. As indicated in Fig. 7, we used both EMSA (Fig. 7A and C) and
Western blot of nuclear extracts for p65 expression (Fig. 7B and D)
to test the effects of 1 or 3 h pre-treatment with parthenolide (20
or 10 lM) on inhibition of TNF-a-induced NF-jB activation. A sig-
nificant decrease of NF-jB translocation to the nucleus was de-
tected after 3 h of parthenolide pre-treatment in both cell lines
used, but in FHC cells, the decrease was apparent only after higher
nes (#3 and #93) with pBIIX-LUC construct after 4, 8, or 24 h treatment with either

concentration of parthenolide. Thus, we used a 3 h pre-treatment
with 10 lM of parthenolide for HT-29 cells and 20 lM for FHC cells
for further experiments. To exclude the effects of this NF-jB inhib-
itor on MAPK pathways, Western blot analysis for phosphorylated
and total protein expression of ERK1/2 and p38 after 3 h of parthe-
nolide pre-treatment (10 lM for HT-29 and 20 lM for FHC cells)
and/or 10 min treatment with EGF (25 ng/ml), which was used as
a positive control for MAPK pathway activation, was performed
(Fig. 7E). No changes in ERK1/2 and p38 phosphorylation and no
inhibition of EGF-mediated MAPK activation was detected after
parthenolide pre-treatment.

Both HT-29 and FHC cells presented decreased sensitivity to
NaBt-mediated inhibition of cell growth after parthenolide pre-
treatment (Fig. 8A). However, cell growth was not significantly af-
fected by TNF-a and NaBt co-treatments in both parthenolide pre-
treated and non-pre-treated cells compared to NaBt alone.

Parthenolide increased apoptosis induced by NaBt (DAPI stain-
ing) in both HT-29 and FHC cells (Fig. 8B). However, apoptosis in-
duced by TNF-a and NaBt co-treatment was modulated by
parthenolide differently in HT-29 and FHC cells. While in HT-29
cells, parthenolide significantly potentiated apoptosis induced by
this type of treatment (3.6-fold increase versus NaBt alone), no sig-
nificant effect of was apparent in FHC cells (1.6-fold increase ver-
sus NaBt alone).

Unlike FHC cells, the differentiation ability of HT-29 cells in-
duced by NaBt was strongly decreased after parthenolide pre-
treatment (Fig. 8C). In FHC cells, the suppressive effect of TNF-a
on NaBt-mediated cell differentiation (5.8-fold decrease of ALP
activity versus NaBt alone) was attenuated after parthenolide
pre-treatment (2.7-fold decrease of ALP activity versus NaBt
alone).

4. Discussion

Colon epithelial cell kinetics may be affected by endogenous
growth regulators or by dietary factors like TNF-a and butyrate,
respectively. We demonstrated that TNF-a markedly reduced
NaBt-induced differentiation in HT-29 colon adenocarcinoma cells
contrary to its potentiation of apoptosis [26]. The ability of TNF-a
to synergize with NaBt in promoting apoptosis in colon cancer cells

was shown also by other authors [27–29]. However, we newly
demonstrate a TNF-a-mediated increase of apoptosis induced by
NaBt in non-cancer cell line (FHC) derived from normal human fe-
tal colon. We found a much more dramatic increase of NaBt-in-
duced differentiation in cancer HT-29 than in fetal FHC cells. This
different dynamic was already demonstrated by Fajkus et al. [30].
Interestingly, NaBt-mediated differentiation was significantly sup-
pressed by TNF-a in both cell lines, with the higher effectiveness in
FHC cells. Furthermore, our results suggest that induction of the
apoptotic process by NaBt is reduced or delayed in fetal cells com-
pared to cancer cells. On the other hand, the potentiation of apop-
tosis by TNF-a and NaBt co-treatment was observed in both cancer
and fetal cells.

We suggested NF-jB to be involved in the mechanism of TNF-a-
induced modulation of cell differentiation and apoptosis mediated
by NaBt. The transcription factor NF-jB can play a pivotal role in
regulating programmed cell death and can possess the ability to
activate both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes [31]. TNF-a
belongs to the typical activators of the canonical pathway of NF-
jB activation, which is completed by p50/p65 heterodimer binding
to DNA. To elucidate the role of NF-jB activation during the inves-
tigated TNF-a and NaBt co-treatment, were compared cancer HT-
29 and fetal FHC colon cell lines with regard to this parameter.
We detected time-dependent TNF-a-induced NF-jB activation in
HT-29 cells using a reporter constructs sensitive to NF-jB activity
(pBIIX-LUC). Moreover, we indicated a strong activation of NF-jB
by TNF-a not only in HT-29, but also in normal FHC cells (results
of EMSA, p65 expression in nuclear extracts, and decreased level
of IjB in whole cell extracts). From the report of Zwacka et al. it
could be supposed that TNF-a-induced prolonged NF-jB activation
is associated with TNF-a resistance [32]. Considering that both HT-
29 and FHC cells are relatively resistant to TNF-a cytotoxicity this
observation is in agreement with our results.

In accord with the results of Rouet-Benzineb et al. we demon-
strated no changes in NF-jB binding activity after short-time treat-
ment with NaBt (4 or 8 h) in both cell lines [33]. However, after
24 h of NaBt treatment, the NF-jB activity was enhanced in both
cells of adenocarcinoma and fetal origin despite the previously
published results that butyrate decreased the activity of this tran-
scription factor [34]. It has been previously found that butyrate
could alter NF-jB subunit composition induced by proinflamma-
tory cytokines. Inan et al. demonstrated that NaBt pre-treatment
of HT-29 cells inhibits the TNF-a-mediated p65 and p50 transloca-
tion to the nucleus [35]. These authors also suggested that NaBt
prevented the NF-jB subunit translocation by suppressing cellular
proteasome activity (and subsequently IjB degradation) through
NaBt ability to inhibit histone deacetylases [24,36]. However, our
results showed that NaBt increased TNF-a-mediated NF-jB bind-
ing activity, p65 nuclear translocation and IjB-a degradation in
cancer HT-29 cells, but not in fetal FHC cells, after 4 h of NaBt
and TNF-a co-treatment. The difference in NaBt ability to modulate
TNF-a-mediated NF-jB activation between cancer and fetal colon
epithelial cells represents the most important finding of the pres-
ent study. The NaBt-mediated increase of TNF-a-induced NF-jB
activity in HT-29 cells disappeared during the subsequent 4 h of
treatment, and after 24 h NaBt significantly inhibited the TNF-a-
induced NF-jB binding activity in both cell lines. The inhibition
of TNF-a-induced p65 nuclear translocation by NaBt pre-treatment
was also indicated in SW480 and SW620 human colon carcinoma
cells [37,29]. While the NaBt concentration around 5 mM, which
corresponds to the physiological concentration in the colon, was
the same in the above-mentioned and our experiments, based on
our previous works [38,39], we used significantly lower doses of

TNF-a (15 ng/ml versus 100 ng/ml) to simulate a bit more the real
level of TNF-a in the colon during chronic inflammatory diseases
(e.g. Crohn’s disease) [6,11]. The difference in the concentrations
of TNF-a used and also application of this cytokine simultaneously
with NaBt (in contrast to NaBt pre-treatment used by the above-
mentioned authors) may play a role in the dissimilarity of our
results.

To study the involvement of NF-jB in the modulation of NaBt
effects by TNF-a, we used an NF-jB inhibitor, sesquiterpene lac-
tone parthenolide. It prevents the NIK- and MEKK1-induced activa-
tion of IKKs, but does not interfere with the induced activation of
MAPKs [40]. We found a significant difference in parthenolide sen-
sitivity between fetal and cancer cells, which may be corresponded
to the distinct way of NF-jB activation in these two cell lines.
Moreover, in cancer cell line, pre-treatment with parthenolide
caused a significant increase of apoptosis induction by NaBt and
TNF-a co-treatment, while, in fetal cells, it inhibited apoptosis in-
duced by this type of treatment. This distinct response could be
associated with lower differentiation status in NaBt- or both NaBt
and TNF-a-treated HT-29 cells after parthenolide pre-treatment
compared with FHC cells.

Our results indicated that NaBt-mediated differentiation and
apoptosis of colon epithelial cells can be modulated by TNF-a. Fur-
thermore, we found significant differences in the mechanism of the
response to NaBt and TNF-a co-treatment between cells of non-
cancer and adenocarcinoma origin, suggesting that the NF-jB
pathway is more effectively involved in these processes in cancer
cells. Our findings imply the possible role of TNF-a in the develop-

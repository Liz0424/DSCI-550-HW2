"Stromal cell death is an important cause of plasma membrane inflammation, and the expression of proinflammatory cytokines is a key step in pathogenesis of plasma membrane inflammation and perturbation of stem cell function. In agreement with our previous findings, it is possible that impaired expression of proinflammatory cytokines could result in impaired growth and development of new epithelial cells, and this effect could be mediated by the proliferation and differentiation of new epithelial cells. In this recent study, we showed that impaired expression of proinflammatory cytokines has a significant effect on the production of new epithelial cells in vitro, and this effect is mediated by the differentiation of new epithelial cells in vivo, thus resulting in impaired development of new epithelial cells. We found that impaired expression of proinflammatory cytokines was associated with a significant decrease in proliferation and differentiation, and this effect was mediated by the normalization of stem cell progenitor cells. Moreover, impaired expression of proinflammatory cytokines could result in a decrease in the number and proliferation of new epithelial cells, thus enhancing the expression of the proinflammatory cytokines in vitro.

"In this recent work, we demonstrated that impaired expression of proinflammatory cytokines in vitro could lead to increased progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation, and thus impaired expression of the proinflammatory cytokines in vivo, and this effect is mediated by the normalization of stem cell progenitor cells. In this study, we found that impaired expression of proinflammatory cytokines could lead to increased progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation, and thus impaired expression of the proinflammatory cytokines in vivo, and this effect is mediated by the normalization of stem cell progenitor cells. Moreover, impaired expression of proinflammatory cytokines could lead to increased progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation, and thus impaired expression of the proinflammatory cytokines in vivo, and this effect is mediated by the normalization of stem cell progenitor cells. These data further demonstrate that the presence of proinflammatory cytokines is a critical step in pathogenesis of plasma membrane inflammation and perturbation of stem cell function."

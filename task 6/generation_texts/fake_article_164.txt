Intracellular cytokines and tumor suppressor protein

in the mouse

microglia were stimulated by a novel anti-

tumor antibody (MiroPhy) (20 mg/ml

in PBS, 5% Tween-6, 5% Tween-3, 0.5%

myc-3, 0.5% Tween-1, 0.25% Tween-1, and 0.25% Tween-1

in Tween-1) in all three experiments. In the

same assay, MiroPhy was found to inhibit cytokine

growth, but not apoptosis, expression of iNOS and

TNF-a. In the mouse lung, the anti-tumor

antibodies (in both Tween-1 and Tween-3) did not inhibit

inflammatory cytokine production or expression of IL-6, IL-5, and IL-12.

In the three experiments, MiroPhy was found to inhibit

inflammatory cytokine production or expression of IL-12 (Fig. 1A). Miro

phy was found to inhibit inflammatory cytokine production, but not

inflammatory cytokine production (Fig. 1B). In the three experiments, Miro

phy was found to inhibit inflammatory cytokine production and expression

of IL-10 and IL-10α, which were not detected in the

mechanisms of MiroPhy (Fig. 1C). In the three experiments,

the anti-inflammatory cytokine production was inhibited by MiroPhy

(Fig. 1D), but not by MiroPhy (Fig. 1B). In the

three experiments, MiroPhy was found to inhibit IL-10, IL-10α

and IL-10β, which were not detected in the MEK1 and

MEK2 cytotoxicity assay (Fig. 1B).

Interestingly, the anti-inflammatory cytokine production was

not inhibited by MiroPhy (Fig. 1C). In the

three experiments, MiroPhy was found to inhibit IL-10, IL-10α, and

IL-10β, which are not detected in the MEK1 and

MEK2 cytotoxicity assay (Fig. 1C).

In the three experiments, MiroPhy was found to inhibit IL-10,

IL-10α, and IL-10β, which are not detected in the MEK1 and

MEK2 cytotoxicity assay (Fig. 1D).

In the three experiments, MiroPhy was found to inhibit IL-10, IL-10α, and

IL-10β, which are not detected in the MEK1 and

MEK2 cytotoxicity assay (Fig. 1E). In the

three experiments, MiroPhy was found to inhibit IL-10, IL-10α, and

IL-10β, which are not detected in the MEK1 and

MEK2 cytotoxicity assay (Fig. 1F).

In the three experiments, MiroPhy was found to inhibit IL-10, IL-10α, and

IL-10β, which are not detected in the MEK1 and

MEK2 cytotoxicity assay (Fig. 1G). In the three

experiments, MiroPhy was found to inhibit IL-10, IL-10α, and

IL-10β, which are not detected in the MEK1 and

MEK2 cytotoxicity assay (Fig. 1G). In the

three experiments, MiroPhy was found to inhibit IL-10, IL-10α, and

IL-10β, which are not detected in the MEK1 and

MEK2 cytotoxicity assay (Fig. 1H). In the three

experiments, MiroPhy was found to inhibit IL-10, IL-10α, and

IL-10β, which are not detected in the MEK1 and

MEK2 cytotoxicity assay (Fig. 1I).

In the three experiments, MiroPhy was found to inhibit IL-10, IL-10α, and

IL-10β, which are not detected in the MEK1 and

MEK2 cytotoxicity assay (Fig. 1J). In the three

experiments, MiroPhy was found to inhibit IL-10, IL-10α, and

IL-10β, which are not detected in the MEK1 and

MEK2 cytotoxicity assay (Fig. 1K). In

Saved time related to the development of cancer

activated by the interplay of the tumor's nuclear and secreted

antibodies.

To explore the mechanisms through which the cannabinoid CB1

and/or CB2 receptors, and their downstream targets,

were modulated by the CB1/CB2 receptor antagonist TNF-a, we

investigated the effects of the various types of CB1 agonist

(TNF-a, TNF-b, or TNF-c) on the effect of the tumor's

antibodies, in response to TNF-a and TNF-b.

In a dose-dependent manner, an increase in mRNA levels of

the two receptor subunits for CB1 and CB2 receptors were

increased when TNF-a was administered, which was counteracted by

TNF-b, which was suppressed by the addition of the

TNF-c receptor antagonist, MDA.

These data indicate that, at the cellular level, the

activation of both CB1/CB2 receptors does not depend on TNF-a

and TNF-b.

To investigate the mechanisms through which the

activation of both receptors by TNF-a and

TNF-b activates the activity of both receptors, we

investigated the effects of CB1/CB2 receptors on the

induced decrease in mRNA levels of the two receptors.

To test this, we measured the levels of TNF-a

and TNF-b in the tissue of daily patients with

severe TNF-a and TNF-b tumors.

To test the effect of TNF-a and TNF-b on the

uptake of protein, we measured the levels of both CB1 and

CB2 receptors. In contrast, the levels of both receptor subunits were

lower when TNF-a was administered and higher when TNF-b

administered.

To determine the effect of TNF-a and TNF-b on the

phytolytic activity of the tumor, we tested the effects of

CB1 and CB2 receptors on the activation of both receptor subunits.

To test the effects of TNF-a and TNF-b on the

activation of both receptor subunits, we compared the mRNA levels of the two receptors

by RT-PCR.

To further examine the effects of CB1 and CB2 receptors,

we measured the activation of the two receptor subunits by

TNF-c and TNF-b.

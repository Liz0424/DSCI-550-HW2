Fluoride is another neurotoxic agent that is found in cerebrospinal fluid and other tissues. The neurotoxic effect of fluoride on the cells of the brain is not only recognized in humans but also in animals.

Molecules are highly permeable while in the brain, the molecular structure of the cells is not well understood. The key question is, what are the molecular structures that regulate the neuronal cell membrane?

"Brain Tumor: A molecular and biochemical study of the immune system and its role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases"

Department of Neurobiology and Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA

Abstract

Brain tumors are a multifactorial phenomenon of disease. The goal of this study is to elucidate the role of brain tumorigenesis in the pathogenesis of these disorders. The experimental design of this study was approved by the Society for the Advancement of Science (USA) and supported by National Institute of Mental Health grants.

Materials and Methods

Cells of cerebrospinal fluid (SCF) were collected from the patients with cerebrospinal fluid acquired from patients with cerebral infarction (CFI) [1]. In this study, SCF was performed in patients with cerebrospinal fluid infection from the same patient with brain tumors. To identify the cellular components in the cerebrospinal fluid of these patients with brain tumors, brains were collected from the patients with cerebrospinal fluid infection (CFI) and cerebrospinal fluid from the same patient with cerebrospinal fluid (SCF) and cerebrospinal fluid from the same patient with cerebrospinal fluid (SCF) and cerebrospinal fluid from the same patient with cerebrospinal fluid (SCF) and cerebrospinal fluid from the same patient with cerebrospinal fluid (SCF) were analyzed.

Results

Cells of cerebrospinal fluid (SCF) were collected from patients with cerebrospinal fluid infection (CFI) and cerebrospinal fluid (SCF) from patients with cerebral infarction (CFI) and cerebrospinal fluid (SCF) from patients with cerebrospinal fluid infections (CFI) and cerebrospinal fluid (SCF) from patients with cerebrospinal fluid infections (CFI) and cerebrospinal fluid infections (SCF) from patients with cerebrospinal fluid (SCF) and cerebrospinal fluid infection (SCF) from patients with cerebrospinal fluid (SCF) and cerebrospinal fluid infection (SCF) from patients with cerebrospinal fluid (SCF) and cerebrospinal fluid infection (SCF) from patients with cerebrospinal fluid infection (SCF) and cerebrospinal fluid infection (SCF) from patients with cerebrospinal fluid infection (SCF) and cerebrospinal fluid infection (SCF) from patients with cerebrospinal fluid infection (SCF) and cerebrospinal fluid infection (SCF) from patients with cerebrospinal fluid infection (SCF) and cerebrospinal fluid infection (SCF) from patients with cerebrospinal fluid infection (SCF) and cerebrospinal fluid infection (SCF) from patients with cerebrospinal fluid infection (SCF) and cerebrospinal fluid infection (SCF) from patients with cerebrospinal fluid infection (SCF) and cerebrospinal fluid infection (SCF) from patients with cerebrospinal fluid infection (SCF) and cerebrospinal fluid infection (SCF) (Figure 1).

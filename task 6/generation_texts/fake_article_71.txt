This is a review of the evidence-based approach to the development of therapeutic vaccines.
Only a small number of vaccine studies have been published. The majority of
research on vaccine efficacy has focused on the safety and immunogenicity of a single
target vaccine. The literature is characterized by the fact that each vaccine has its own unique
effect
effect and that the mechanisms of vaccine efficacy are rarely fully understood. These
studies reveal the importance of the various immunogenicity mechanisms in
vaccination.

The first preclinical study of the effects of TNF-alpha in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed that TNF-alpha activates the transcriptional/adhesion molecule-2 (OTM-2) axis of the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (IFN-1) and the ADH axis of the intercellular adhesion molecule-2 (IFN-2). The results demonstrated that TNF-alpha treatment did not affect IFN-1 and IFN-2 axis in the plasma of TNF-alpha-treated human fibroblasts.

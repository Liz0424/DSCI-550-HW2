Santa Rosa, CA (August 21, 2014) – An international study has revealed that neonatal exposure to antoinositol (AT) induces the development of a form of hemoglobinopathogenesis. A change in hemoglobin concentration was observed in a small rodent model of hemoglobinopathogenesis and significantly increased hemoglobin concentration was also observed in a human model of hemoglobinopathogenesis. The study has been published in the Journal of the American Society for Applied Laboratory Science.

The study appeared in the online July 21, 2014 issue of JAMA.

The rat model of hemoglobinopathogenesis is an example of the development of hemoglobinopathogenesis. Hemoglobinopathogenesis is a condition in which the survival of small and intermediate sized mammals is impaired, due to the apparent lack of oxygenation within the blood. The development of hemoglobinopathogenesis is an important and incurable condition for mammals, in which the blood is not able to flow efficiently and efficiently. Hemoglobinopathogenesis is a rare and fatal condition.

In this study, we found that ten minutes of exposure to antoinositol (AT) produced an increase in hemoglobin concentration in a small rodent model of hemoglobinopathogenesis. As reported previously, there was a significant increase in hemoglobin concentration in mice exposed to AT but not in human subjects. At this time, the hemoglobin concentration in rat models of hemoglobinopathogenesis was similar to that in human subjects.

The rat model of hemoglobinopathogenesis was also similar to that observed in the rat model of hemoglobinopathogenesis. The hemoglobin concentration in rat models of hemoglobinopathogenesis was similar to that of human subjects. As reported previously, treatment with AT produced an increase in hemoglobin concentration in humans.

The study was supported by the National Science Foundation

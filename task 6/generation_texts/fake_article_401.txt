A study has shown that a high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet (HFD) can reduce the risk of diabetes in diabetic patients. This study, in contrast, demonstrated that a low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet (HFD) can reduce the risk of diabetes in diabetic patients. We investigated the effects of a metabolic- and histologic-insulin-binding-2 (HIF2) inhibitor on the insulin sensitivity of patients with type 2 diabetes by measuring insulin sensitivity in the colon. We found that HFD treatment with an inhibitor of low-density lipoprotein lipase (LDL-trim) efficiently reduced the insulin sensitivity of the colon by decreasing the accumulation of lipoproteins (LDLs) (13). This study also showed that HFD treatment with an inhibitor of MDA-7 (MDA7) significantly reduced the insulin sensitivity of the colon by increasing the expression of insulin receptors, which is an important determinant of insulin sensitivity (14). We also found that HFD treatment with the inhibitor of MDA-2 (MDA2) significantly reduced the expression of insulin receptor 1 (IR1) (15) and serum insulin, which are known to be implicated in insulin resistance, in a rat model of type 2 diabetes.

In this study, we studied the effects of the HFD on the insulin sensitivity of patients with type 2 diabetes. We found that HFD treatment with an inhibitor of MDA2 significantly reduced the insulin sensitivity of the colon by decreasing the accumulation of lipoproteins (LDL-trim) (13). This study also showed that HFD treatment with an inhibitor of MDA2 significantly reduced the incidence of type 2 diabetes, which is a sign of a diabetic immune response.

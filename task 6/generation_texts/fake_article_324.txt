(Phys.org) -- Physiological responses to the effects of a high-fat diet on the heart are not well known. However, an effect of a high-fat diet on the heart has been reported by R. B. Michalak and R. A. V. Leblanc, using a longitudinal study of a low-fat diet. The study included 120 subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (LDT) and 150 with type 1 diabetes mellitus (SAD) and assessed the effect of a high-fat diet on the heart. After 8 weeks, the mean daily cholesterol-lowering dose of insulin (I2C) was increased to a concentration of 25 mg/dl. The mean daily glucose-lowering dose of insulin (Glyc) was increased to a concentration of 5 mg/dl. The mean daily protein-lowering dose of insulin (I2C) was increased to a concentration of 30 mg/dl. The mean daily glucose-lowering dose of insulin (I2C) was increased to a concentration of 20 mg/dl. The mean daily insulin-lowering dose of insulin (I2C) was increased to a concentration of 20 mg/dl. The mean daily protein-lowering dose of insulin (I2C) was increased to a concentration of 30 mg/dl. The mean daily glucose-lowering dose of insulin (I2C) was increased to a concentration of 20 mg/dl. The mean daily insulin-lowering dose of insulin (I2C) was increased to a concentration of 30 mg/dl. The mean daily insulin-lowering dose of insulin (I2C) was increased to a concentration of 30 mg/dl.

Since the effect of a high-fat diet on the heart is not well known, it seems that a high-fat diet might be beneficial in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, although it has been shown that the effects of a high-fat diet are not well known
The effect of a high-fat diet on the heart is not well known, but it might be a good idea to follow a high-fat diet.

In this study, we found several unique interactions between insulin and the heart. The effects of a high-fat diet on the heart are not well known, but it might be a good idea to follow a high-fat diet.

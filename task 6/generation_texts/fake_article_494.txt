Cancer and The Endocrine System

Abstract

The endocrine system has been implicated in both the genetic and environmental factors of cancer. Genes like histone acetylation and histone acetylation C are expressed in both male and female human breast cancer cells. In this review, we describe the current understanding of the endocrine system and discuss some of the molecular and genetic structure and function of the endocrine system. We also describe the role of histone acetylation in the development of breast cancer.

Introduction

The endocrine system is a complex system that includes: the endocrine glands, the pancreas, the endocrine glands and the endocrine glands glandulars. The endocrine glands are the endocrine glands of the pancreas, the pancreas glandulars, the endocrine glands glandulars, the endocrine glands glandular glandulars and the endocrine glands glandulars. The endocrine glands process adipose tissue (AD), cells and secretory protein molecules (APM) in the body. The endocrine glands are located in the endocrine glands of the pancreas, the pancreas glandulars and the endocrine glands glandulars. The endocrine glands process adipose tissue (AD), cells and secretory protein molecules (APM) in the body. The endocrine glands are located in the endocrine glands of the pancreas, the pancreas glandulars and the endocrine glands glandulars. The endocrine glands process adipose tissue (AD), cells and secretory protein molecules (APM) in the body.

Research Summary

Estrogen receptors for endocrine function are essential for maintaining quality of life and promoting health and well-being [1]. Estrogen receptor gene variants are known to be associated with both endocrine and breast cancer [2].

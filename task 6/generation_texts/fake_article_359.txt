Rice protein binders are the most abundant of the MAPK protein-binding sites in the low intestine. They have been shown to bind to MAPKs more than to sense protein. The binding sites of the protein binding proteins (MAPKs) (2, 3, 4) are also present in the smooth muscle of mice (5–6) (7). The binding of the MAPKs (5, 7) to the smooth muscle of mice has been reported to be inhibited (8–10). Recently, we reported a new binding site for the MAPKs (9) that is further separated from the smooth muscle of mice (6, 11).

It has been suggested that the binding of the protein binding to the MAPKs (5, 7) may be involved in the pathogenesis of obesity (2, 3, 4). However, the molecular basis of this mechanism remains unclear.
In the present study, we confirmed that the MAPKs (5, 7) bind to the smooth muscle of mice. We also confirmed the presence of a protein binding site for the MAPKs (5, 7) in the smooth muscle of mice (6).

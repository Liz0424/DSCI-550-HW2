Abstract
This study demonstrates that the estrogen receptor regulates the expression of
the estrogen receptor 1 (ER1) and ER2 in human breast cancer cells. Developmentally,
and by normalization, ER1 and ER2 expression in breast cancer cells was reduced. On the other hand, expression of ER2 in breast
melanoma cells is increased. This study indicates that ER1, ER2 and ER1 are regulated by the
therapeutic effects of estrogen.

Keywords: ER1, ER2, ER1

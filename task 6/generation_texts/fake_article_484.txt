I am a very happy man. I wanted to show how I could use this tool to treat my breast cancer. I had indicated that, although I had a good enough prognosis (P,0.05), I was just not able to treat my breast cancer.

I started the program by using a regimen of 4 days of pre- and post-treatment. I was then able to start and maintain a 3 week dietary pattern as well as gain weight.

There were four different treatments for breast cancer. I started with the first treatment, chemotherapy, followed by radiation and memory enhancement. I followed the second treatment with chemotherapy followed by bifidobacteria, followed by radiation. I followed the third treatment with radiation followed by hypoxia.

After the third treatment with radiation, I started with a 3 week dietary pattern. I also started with the 4 week diet. I was able to start and maintain a 3 week dietary pattern. The treatment duration was 4-6 days, and I was able to start and maintain a 3 week dietary pattern. I then started chemo and memory enhancement.

I had no cancer and had no disease.

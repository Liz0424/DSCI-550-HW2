Methods

The two-stage TEST is known to be an endogenous test of

human testosterone. The TEST is administered to the male

subject for a short time, and the male subject is required to

enlarged the testicular cavity.

The male subjects were randomly assigned to either the

TEST or the non-TEST TEST.

The male subjects were blinded to the presence of a

toxic effect of the testicle on the male subject.

Vitamins and other dietary supplements were used to treat the

TEST.

TEST Control

The TEST was administered to the male subject for a

short time, and the male subject was required to enlarge the

tumor.

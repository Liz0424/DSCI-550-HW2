A laboratory experiment was carried out in which the dose-response analyses were performed by using three different methods:

(1) a different dose-response analysis of the dose-response data obtained from the residue analyses and (2) the caseâ€“control analyses.

The results shown in Fig. 1 were confirmed by the two methods of the experiments, by the superscript analyses and the analysis of the study itself.

The difference of the dose-response data obtained by the two methods was found to be significant only when the amount of the protein was significantly higher in the presence of the protein at the dose-response time.

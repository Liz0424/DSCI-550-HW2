A study of the brain apoptosis observed that activation of transcription factor B15 or ERK1 leads to increased apoptosis and a deregulated ERK1-dependent apoptosis, an indication that disruption of ERK1 regulates the brain apoptosis.

The NF-kappaB pathway is involved in neurotoxic effects such as cell death, cell apoptosis and neuronal tissue damage. NF-kappaB is a common transcription factor that acts as an abrogating factor. Its role in cell death and apoptosis is not well understood. In this study, we first examined the role of NF-kappaB on the NF-kappaB-induced neurotoxicity in rats at a high-risk for motor neuron disease (NOS). NOS is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with a deficiency of cellular and metabolic functions, including neuronal cells and neurons. NF-kappaB is a common transcription factor that appears to act as a deregulator of NF-kappaB-induced neurotoxicity. NF-kappaB-mediated neurotoxicity was associated with decreased neuronal cell release, increased cell apoptosis, and loss of neuronal cell migration, leading to neuronal cell death, decreased cell migration, cell apoptosis and cell loss. Our results suggest that NF-kappaB may play a role in NF-kappaB-induced neurotoxicity in NOS.

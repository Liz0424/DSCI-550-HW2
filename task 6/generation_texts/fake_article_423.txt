A new study has shown that reducing the ratio of B-actin to C-terminal TGF-β1 shows an increase in oxidative stress as well as apoptosis in mice. The present study is the first to explore the relationship between B-actin and oxidative stress in vivo using a transgenic mouse model.

Introduction

B-actin is a non-enzymatic protein which regulates mitochondrial function and cell die-off. It is a transcriptional activator of transcription and activator of NF-kB signaling.

The enzymatic activity of B-actin is found in cells and in the cytoplasm of cells. Although the precise mechanism under which B-actin affects cell death is unknown, the effects of B-actin on cellular death are likely to be mediated by ROS-driven mechanisms.

B-actin is a transcriptional activator of transcription, activator of NF-kB, and activator of apoptosis in a variety of cell types.

The effect of B-actin on cell death is currently unknown, but the current study shows that B-actin may be involved in cell death by activating ROS-driven processes.

The inhibition of ROS-driven processes by B-actin has been previously described, thus the mechanism of the inhibition of B-actin by ROS-driven processes would not be of interest. In this study, we show that B-actin is likely to activate ROS-driven processes and that the inhibitory effect of B-actin at the cell surface of the mouse is mediated by the inhibition of ROS-driven processes.

In this study, we showed that B-actin inhibits ROS-driven processes through inhibition of the activation of NF-kB signaling and activation of transcription.
Human B-actin+/− mice were injected with B-actin (10 mM) over the course of 12 h and treated with 7 mM of B-actin (10 mM) for 6 h.

The results showed that B-actin was able to inhibit ROS-driven processes by inhibiting NF-kB signaling and activation of transcription.

In summary, B-actin-induced ROS-driven processes may be mediated by ROS-driven processes through inhibition of NF-kB signaling, inhibition of transcription, activation of transcription, activation of transcription, activation of transcription.

In conclusion, B-actin in combination with B-actin-sensitive transcriptional activator activates ROS-driven processes and causes ROS-driven processes in the tissues of human and mouse.

Introduction

The use of antibiotics in the treatment of HIV/AIDS has been a major concern for the United States.

Over the last several years, antibiotic resistance has increased dramatically, both in the United States and in other countries around the globe.

However, the United States results in the lowest numbers of infections in the world, and this increase has created a shortage of antibiotics for the treatment of HIV/AIDS.

In 2011, the United States reported the highest number of infections in the world, followed by China, India, and Canada.

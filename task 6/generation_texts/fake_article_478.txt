A good variety of factors can affect the output of a given signal across the range of available signals (Figure 8, Table S2). For example, the properties of monoamine oxidase-1 (MAO1) can be affected by multiple factors, including the factors under study and their effects on MAO1 expression (Figure 9, Table S3).

Cancer cells were infected with the cytoplasmic-

containing vector (cDNA) and the cytosolic-

containing vector (cDNA) for 48 h. Cells were harvested at the

time indicated, and transfected with cytoplasmic-

containing vector (cDNA) and the cytosolic-containing vector

(cDNA) and the cytotoxic-

antagonist (Cox) for 48 h.

Cells were harvested at the time indicated and

transfected with cDNA, cytoplasmic-containing

vector (cDNA) and the cytosolic-containing vector (cDNA)

Cell culture

Cells were grown in the presence or absence of C-ap-

nacaine (pH 7.0) for 50 min, and membranes were loaded with the

silica gel (Sigma, Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Images were captured by
sensor-assisted and re-sampled by growing the

cells at the time indicated for the experiment.

Growth of the clonal kangaroosomes, a common feature of the embryonal kangaroosome, is captured by a
synaptic microtubule (Fig. 6A and B) that is formed by a fast-fading membrane in the
tubules of the subcellular system of the embryonal kangaroosome (Fig. 6A and B, C and D).
Although the tubular membrane is not completely opaque, it is
partially opaque. The tubular membrane is blocked by erythrocyte activity and
reduces the chromophore activity of the tubules (Fig. 6A and B, C and D).
The tubular membrane also inhibits erythrocyte activity in the basal gland, the
basal gland of the fetus and in the ovaries of the mature male K.
genes, and the erythrocyte activity of the fetus and the ovaries of the mature female K.
genes (Fig. 6A and C).

Although the tubular membrane is opaque, it is not transparent and
and it is not blocked by erythrocyte activity (Fig. 6A and C), it is
not clearly evident in the central tubules of the embryonal kangaroosome.

The tubular membrane is not blocked by erythrocyte activity but rather by erythrocyte-retinal
activity.

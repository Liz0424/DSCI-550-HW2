In the case of pheomelanoma, the oligo- and oligo-induced responses of the cytoplasmic domain is stimulated by acetylcholine. The cytoplasmic domain of the culture was incubated with the pheomelanoma cell line (Cell Culture) as described previously [9] and phosphorylated from the cytoplasmic domain was incubated with the pheomelanoma cell line (Cell Culture) as described previously [8] as well as phosphorylated from the cytoplasmic domain was incubated with the pheomelanoma cell line (Cell Culture) as described previously [6]. The same was done with the pheomelanoma cell line (Cell Culture) as described previously [6].

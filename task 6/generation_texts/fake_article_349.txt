Nationally, there has been a large increase in the number of OMUs in the United States over the past three decades. In 2012, our 6,000 patients with HIV/AIDS were counted at the NIH from 1994 to 2009.

In 2013, the United States and Canada reported the highest number of patients with HIV/AIDS. The highest number of patients in the United States was estimated from the NIH. In 2013, the United States reported the greatest number of patients with HIV/AIDS.

HIV/AIDS is a highly complex disease characterized by high seroprevalence and an aging population. The current epidemic burden is estimated to be between 100 million and 200 million people. For a more detailed assessment of the epidemic burden, please refer to the National Center for AIDS Research (NCCAR) publication, Relation of HIV/AIDS to Public Health.

The antiretroviral therapy (AR) regimen in HIV/AIDS patients is effective mainly for several reasons. The use of new antiretroviral drugs is associated with the development of AIDS. The development of AIDS has occurred primarily through lymphatic and renal disease. The use of new antiretroviral drugs can be a barrier to the development of AIDS. In addition, new antiretroviral drugs can increase the risk of HIV infection by inhibiting a seroconversion of DNA generated by HIV virus. The development of AIDS can be a burden of the health care system.

In 2007, the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) was established as a non-profit organization. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is a partnership between HHS and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is the primary organization for the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of HIV/AIDS. The Department of Health and Human Services is an independent non-profit organization.

S.P.P.T.A.

[2.35]

L.A.S.K. is a a proteasome and proteasome of

T. aeruginosa that is used as a substrate for

protein degradation. It is a proteasome of T. aeruginosa

that has been shown to function in a number of subcellular

pathways. The, shown in Figure S1, is a depolytic

protein that is acquired in the colon and liver. The

protein is specific to T. aeruginosa and has been described

to be present in the gut, intestinal, and liver of

human A. aeruginosa.

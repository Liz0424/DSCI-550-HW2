A new study has found that when the p53S6A protein is expressed in the intestinal epithelium, the form of the p53S6A protein is reduced in the colostomy of mice.

Results of the study have shown that the p53S6A protein was reduced in the intestinal epithelial cells of mice.
The results of this study demonstrate that p53S6A can be expressed in the intestinal epithelium.
The p53S6A protein has been used to treat patients with IBS.
The study by Liu and colleagues reported that the inhibition of the expression of the p53S6A protein in the intestinal epithelium was due to an unmediated effect of the p53S6A protein on the expression of the p53S6A protein.
The researchers also found that the inhibition of the expression of the p53S6A protein in the intestinal epithelium was due to an inhibition of the expression of the p53S6A protein.

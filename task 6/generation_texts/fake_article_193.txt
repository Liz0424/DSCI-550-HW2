Abstract

The p-glycoprotein protein PGF-3 was first described in 1977, and it has been associated with the development of various diseases. The current study is the first to examine the association between p-glycoprotein PGF-3 and p-glycoprotein PGF-3. We show that p-glycoprotein PGF-3 inhibits the expression of p-glycoprotein PGF-3 in several sclerosis cells. We are also able to study p-glycoprotein PGF-3 expression in a murine model of latent lesion.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Primary experimental animal (n = 12), secondary animal (n = 9) and experimental animal (n = 12) were purchased from the University of Arizona and/or the University of California at Davis. The animal was housed in a 3-d room at a single-occupancy room with a 2-hour light cycle. Both experimental animals were housed in an open-air room with a 2-hour light cycle.

RESULTS

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The animals were housed in the same three-d-room fixed-room with a 2-hour light cycle. The animals were gated in a two-by-two-by-two-by-two-by-two-by-two-by-two-by-two-by-two-by-two-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-two-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-by-three-

The treatment of pre-frontal cortex with the MMP-1/HIF-1-EP-4-2-C-2-A-E-A-E-E-A-E-A-E-A-E
(HIF-1) or HIF-1-EP-4-2-C-2-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A
(EUG-1) neurons was performed by the same technique as described for
EUG-1 neurons in the same study.

A. MMP-1/HIF-1-EP-4-2-C-2-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A
(EUG-1) is the main active agent
in the MMP-1/HIF-1-EP-4-2-C-2-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A

and the HIF-1/EUG-1 neurons in the same study were
treated with either the PBS/GEL
(PBS) or the PBS/GEL
(GEL) (8,20,40,

4,44,48,64,

(PBS) or the PBS/GEL
(GEL).

The PBS/GEL
(GEL) neurons were treated with either
HIF-1/EUG-1 or PBS/GEL for 2 h.

B. MMP-1/N-A-EP-4-2-C-2-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-

(EUG-1)

The PBS/GEL
(GEL) neurons were treated with either
N-A-EUG-1 or PBS/GEL
(EUG-1) for 2 h.

C. MMP-1/HIF-1-EP-4-2-C-2-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-E-A-

Acute hepatic steatosis is a chronic inflammatory condition

and represents a major challenge for hepatic function.

We investigated the effect of addition of fatty acids on the

reversal of hepatic steatosis in mice. A single oral dose of fatty-acid-containing

foods (25g/kg/day) significantly enhanced the

transient response of hepatic steatosis in mice. The

preliminary results showed that fatty-acid-containing fatty-acid foods greatly reduced

the

transient response of hepatic steatosis in mice. The

results suggest that a single oral dose of these foods significantly

reduces the hepatic steatosis response in mice.

Treating hepatic steatosis with fatty-acid intake

could reduce hepatic steatosis response in mice.

In order to improve the hepatic steatosis response

by improving hepatic steatosis, additional fatty acids (25g/kg/day)

were injected into the hepatic steatosis mice. The fecal

pregnan immunostaining indicated that 25g/kg/day is sufficient to

increase hepatic steatosis in mice. These results are consistent with

the finding that 25g/kg/day is sufficient to have hepatic steatosis.

Dietary fatty acids are commonly used as adjuvant agents in

heart disease treatment. Several studies have indicated that dietary fats

have an important role in controlling hepatic steatosis and the

potential of its effects on hepatic steatosis. In this

study, we evaluated the effect of dietary fatty-acid intake on

the hepatic steatosis response in mice. In addition, we examined the

potential of dietary fatty-acid intake on hepatic steatosis.

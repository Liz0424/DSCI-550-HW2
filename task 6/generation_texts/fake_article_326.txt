The adsorbed compound increases the pH of the membrane by 300 to 400 P

at 4°C. The pH of the membrane is reduced by up to 100 to 200 P

at 2°C.

PKH

PKH (PKA) is a member of the family of proteins that act as a ligand for the

protein family of B-actin. B-actin binds to PKH, which is a

protein kinase that activates the protein kinase C

activity. Inhibitors of PKH activate the protein kinase C
activity. PKH is a member of the family of proteins that

act as ligands for the ligand family that act as a ligand for the

protein family of B-actin. B-actin binds to PKH, which is a

protein kinase that activates the protein kinase C
activity. PKH is a member of the family of proteins that

act as ligands for the ligand family that act as a ligand for the

protein family of B-actin. B-actin binds to PKH, which is a

protein kinase that activates the protein kinase Cactivity. PKH is a member of the

family of proteins that act as ligands for the ligand family that act as a

ligand for the protein family of B-actin.

The interaction between PKH and B-actin is independent of the

protein kinase Cactivity. The activity of PKH is independent of the

protein kinase Cactivity. The interaction of B-actin with the protein kinase Cactivity

is independent of the protein kinase Cactivity. The interaction of PKH and B-actin is independent
of the protein kinase Cactivity. The interaction of B-actin with the protein kinase Cactivity

is independent of the protein kinase Cactivity.

Abstract

Although many studies have revealed that the liver is highly sensitive to insulin, the mechanism of action of insulin is not fully understood. In this study, we specifically examined the interaction between insulin and glucose metabolism, and found that insulin has major effects on glucose utilization in the liver, including inhibition of hepatic glucose uptake and increased insulin resistance. Moreover, the body of this study also exposed subjects to a fat-soluble lipoprotein lipoprotein lipoprotein (LpN) lipoprotein (LpR) lipoprotein lipoprotein (LpN) lipoprotein (LpN) lipoprotein (LpR) and lysates (Ln) lipoproteins. We found that LpN lipoprotein lipoprotein (LpN) lipoprotein (LpN) is a very important element of the hepatic insulin response, and that its effect is mediated by hepatic insulin resistance. We then investigated whether LpN lipoprotein lipoprotein (LpN) is sensitive to insulin, and whether this sensitivity is mediated by hepatic insulin resistance. The results were confirmed by the fact that insulin and glucose utilization were not different in patients with diabetes mellitus. The results suggested that LpN lipoprotein lipoprotein (LpN) is sensitive to insulin, but the effect was not mediated by hepatic insulin resistance.

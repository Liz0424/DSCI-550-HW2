Kai Norella of the University of Notre Dame School of Medicine and Dentistry has conducted a study of the effects of a novel antipsychotic, the selective naloxone (SNA), on the brain of a rat model of Alzheimer's disease. The results suggest that the antagonists SNA and TNA have different effects on the development of Alzheimer's disease.

The TNA is a novel antipsychotic, and its side effects are independent of its effect on the brain.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of the SNA and the selective naloxone (SNA) on the development of Alzheimer�s disease (AD) in a rat model of AD.

The rats were tested by a double-blind, 1-week exposure to selective naloxone (SNA) for three weeks.
The rats were then exposed to SNA for two weeks, and then were exposed to TNA for one week.
After three weeks, a representative sample of the rats was dissected, and the animals were perfused with the selective naloxone (SNA) and the selective naloxone (TNA) for three weeks.
The results showed that the selective naloxone (SNA) and the selective naloxone (TNA) were not related to Alzheimer�s disease.
The results showed that the selective naloxone (SNA) and the selective naloxone (TNA) had different effects on the brain development of AD.

The results showed that the selective naloxone (SNA) and the selective naloxone (TNA) had different effects on the development of AD.

Both the selective naloxone (SNA) and the selective naloxone (TNA) have different effects on the development of AD.

The results showed that the selective naloxone (SNA) is associated with the development of AD, whereas the selective naloxone (TNA) is associated with the development of AD.
The results showed that the selective naloxone (SNA) and the selective naloxone (TNA) have different effects on the development of AD.

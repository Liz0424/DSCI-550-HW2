Description: For sampling features of the task 3, I first identify these features from author_result.csv: 'Title','Citation','DOI','Year','FINDINGS','affiliation','lab_size',
'Highest_degree','Degree_area','Publication_Rate','Other Journals Published In', and 'duration of Career(Years)', then I have created the python file titled random_sampling.ipython to make each of identified features as every list and random sampling elements of each list one by one to generate the result dataset named sampling.csv.

Requirements: 
Following requirements are needed to be satisfied to run all the codes:
Packages to be installed:
1.pandas
To install above package, we use this command: pip install pandas


Data Sources:
1.author_result.csv
This dataset is from the folder named task 4 which is from our HW1 folder named TEAM_HAPPYDATA_DSCI550_HW_BIGDATA 2.


Running the code file named random_sampling.ipython :
I just run the file cell by cell directly to get the dataset sampling.csv.
